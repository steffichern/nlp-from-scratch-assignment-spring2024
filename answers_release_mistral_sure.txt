 The ACL 60-60 evaluation sets are used to evaluate a challenge task in speech-to-text and text-to- speech translation. They contain parallel speech, transcripts, and translations for ten language pairs, totaling approximately one hour of data each for the development and evaluation sets. The purpose is to test systems under realistic use cases where recorded technical presentations are accompanied by their corresponding papers. These sets come from ACL 2022 technical presentations and are originally in English but transcribed and translated into ten target languages. During the evaluation campaign, only the development set is provided, and participants may potentially crawl additional in-domain data for adaptation. For metrics, translation output is evaluated using chrF, BLEU, COMET, and ASR output using WER. The official rankings are based on average chrF across all 10 language pairs.

 The benefits of FLARE over existing retrieval augmented LMs are that it decides when and what to retrieve during generation based on the intents of future generations, as opposed to directly using the user input as the query for retrieval or generating the complete answer at once. This results in active interleaving of retrieval and generation, improving long-form generation performance across tasks/datasets.

 The BigCode project is an open-scientific collaboration that focuses on the responsible development of Large Language Models for Code (Code LLMs). They introduced StarCoder and StarCoderBase, which are 15.5B parameter models with infilling capabilities and fast large-batch inference. StarCoderBase was trained on data from The Stack, a large collection of permissively licensed GitHub repositories, and fine-tuned to create StarCoder. The project performed comprehensive evaluations showing that StarCoderBase outperforms other open Code LLMs and matches or outperforms the OpenAI code- cushman-001 model. Additionally, they made important steps towards safe open-access model release, including an improved PII redaction pipeline and a novel attribution tracing tool.

 The context does not provide specific information about the benefits of using a hybrid model approach for identifying hedges. However, it mentions the importance of generating hedges at the right time in peer-tutoring environments (RQ1) and investigating the features that contribute to accurate predictions of hedge placement (RQ2). It also discusses different types of hedges and their functions in conversation, as well as various methods for automatic hedge detection and generation. The context emphasizes the need for further research on effective hedge strategy generation and the challenges of generating hedges in real-time conversations with large language models like ChatGPT. Therefore, it is not explicitly stated that a hybrid model approach has benefits for identifying hedges, but it does suggest that multiple approaches are being explored to address this challenge.

 TASTE uses modeling longer user-item interaction sequences to better characterize user behaviors. (Reference: "When the sequences are separated into different numbers of subsequences, TASTE reduces the GPU memory usage and achieves even slightly better recommendation performance. Our attention sparsity method has the ability to reduce the self-attention computations and potentially break the boundary of existing pretrained language models to model long user-item interactions, which is important in more realistic scenarios that have sufficient product purchase history and restaurant visiting history.")

SPAE PaLM uses a codebook from the input embedding layer of a PaLM 2-S checkpoint with a 65k vocabulary of sentence pieces, while SPAE GPT employs a byte-pair encoding vocabulary with 99k UTF-8 tokens and obtains contextual token embeddings from OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002.

 Modeling conversational context with entity graphs can be used to improve the precision of passage ranking in conversational search systems, as shown by experiments on TREC CAsT datasets. These graphs represent entities mentioned in the current question and retrieved answers, some of which are central or important to the conversation topic, while others may only be peripherally related. The challenge lies in distinguishing these entities and using them effectively to enhance understanding of the conversation context. This approach has shown improvements in nDCG@3 and P@3 for the CAsT 2019 dataset, but results on CAsT 2020 were less competitive due to the importance of having a sufficient number of relevant entities in the top passages. Queries are often the main source of these relevant entities, which help keep the graph on topic and filter out non-relevant entities introduced by passages.

 The solution proposed in the BASS paper to address the issue with training end-to-end speech summarization models on very large inputs is block-wise modeling, where a model processes a portion of input frames at a time. This allows one to train summarization models on very long sequences incrementally and pass semantic context across blocks.

 Reciprocal rank is a metric used in information retrieval to measure the position of the first relevant item in a given ranking. It is defined as the reciprocal of the position of the first relevant item, or 1 if no relevant items are retrieved. The distribution of ties amongst system rankings for different values of reciprocal rank was analyzed in the context, revealing that the probability of observing a tie increases as the number of relevant items and the position of the first relevant item decrease.

 The usage of a highly-weighted ToM listener leads to significant performance and fluency gains for speaker models. This is evident in the findings that high-weight ToM speaker models achieve accuracy gains of 3.0% and 4.6% on easy and hard distractors, respectively (as shown in Table 1). Additionally, these models generate longer and more complex utterances, resulting in fluency improvements of up to 15.6% relative increase for both easy and hard distractors. However, it's important to note that speaker models using a combined speaker-ToM score generally do not outperform those without a ToM listener in training.
