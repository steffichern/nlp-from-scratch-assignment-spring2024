ABSTRACT 
Characterizing the dynamics of behavior across multiple modalities 
and individuals is a vital component of computational behavior 
analysis. This is especially important in certain applications, such 
as psychotherapy, where individualized tracking of behavior pat-
terns can provide valuable information about the patient‚Äôs mental 
state. Conventional methods that rely on aggregate statistics and 
correlational metrics may not always sufce, as they are often un-
able to capture causal relationships or evaluate the true probability 
of identifed patterns. To address these challenges, we present a 
novel approach to learning multimodal and interpersonal represen-
tations of behavior dynamics during one-on-one interaction. Our 
approach is enabled by the introduction of a multiview extension 
of latent change score models, which facilitates the concurrent 
capture of both inter-modal and interpersonal behavior dynamics 
and the identifcation of directional relationships between them. 
A core advantage of our approach is its high level of interpretabil-
ity while simultaneously achieving strong predictive performance. 
We evaluate our approach within the domain of therapist-client 
interactions, with the objective of gaining a deeper understand-
ing about the collaborative relationship between the two, a crucial 
element of the therapeutic process. Our results demonstrate im-
proved performance over conventional approaches that rely upon 
summary statistics or correlational metrics. Furthermore, since our 
multiview approach includes the explicit modeling of uncertainty, 
it naturally lends itself to integration with probabilistic classifers, 
such as Gaussian process models. We demonstrate that this inte-
gration leads to even further improved performance, all the while 
maintaining highly interpretable qualities. Our analysis provides 
compelling motivation for further exploration of stochastic systems 
within computational models of behavior.

1 INTRODUCTION 
To address mental health concerns successfully, it is critical to 
provide individuals with the necessary support to ensure their 
commitment to accomplishing their therapeutic treatment. One 
of the most important elements in fostering such commitment is 
the cultivation of a positive relationship between the client and 
the therapist. Empirical evidence has indicated that clients who 
share a positive relationship with their therapist are less likely to 
discontinue therapy [3] and more likely to experience favorable 
treatment outcomes [7, 36]. Therefore, it is essential to monitor the 
development of this relationship over the course of treatment to 
allow the therapist to adjust their approach to better meet the 
needs of the client. Unfortunately, obtaining genuine feedback 
from therapy clients can prove to be a challenge: clients often 
express hesitation due to concerns about confdentiality, fear of 
negative consequences, or a desire to please the therapist [37, 53]. 
However, computational modeling techniques have demonstrated 
considerable potential in simulating and forecasting other social 
constructs. 
The task of modeling of human behavior is a challenging one, 
as it involves many factors. One such factor is the need to con-
sider how each person afects and is afected by the other people 
around them [ 51, 60]. This reciprocity between interacting people 
is one of the greatest infuences on an individual‚Äôs behavior in 
such contexts [ 31]. Furthermore, modeling social behavior during 
therapeutic treatment can be even more challenging than model-
ing social behavior in other contexts. Clients often exhibit greater 
vulnerability, openness, and self-refection during therapy than 
they do in their everyday behavior [19]. This heightened state of 
engagement can lead to more intense emotional experience and ex-
pression, which can signifcantly afect the nature of the therapeutic 
conversation [35]. 
Another factor complicating the study of human behavior is 
the fact that information is communicated through many diferent 
modalities simultaneously. It is well-established that verbal and non-
verbal behavior is interconnected [4, 17, 41] and ofer diferent kinds 
of information [12, 13], but during therapy, the relationship between 
the two is particularly signifcant. Research has demonstrated that 
verbal behavior tends to more accurately refect a person‚Äôs thoughts, 
while nonverbal behavior tends to more accurately refect a person‚Äôs 
emotions [12, 45, 60]. However, this consistency (or inconsistency) of information provided across diferent modalities can reveal valu-
able insights into the client‚Äôs therapeutic experience [4, 29, 44]. 
Finally, when studying human behavior, it is imperative to ac-
knowledge that our behavior is not static, but rather changes over 
time. Examining the dynamics of behavior is critical, as it allows for 
the identifcation of patterns and trends, and potentially even recog-
nition of causal relationships between variables [8, 57]. Observing 
how an individual adapts their behavior in response to changes 
in others‚Äô behavior can provide a wealth of information about the 
nature of their relationship [22, 34]. This observation is particularly 
valuable in the therapeutic context, where the client‚Äôs reactions to 
diferent prompts or actions of the therapist also serve as valuable 
indicators of their current mental state [8, 40]. 
This paper proposes a novel methodology for developing ef-
fective representations of human behavior during social interac-
tion. Our suggested approach uses structural equation modeling to 
learn a representation of behavior dynamics that can ofer a more 
comprehensive understanding of the causal relationships between 
behaviors and how each person‚Äôs behavior afects and is afected 
by the behavior of others. We demonstrate an application of this 
approach in evaluating the strength of the relationship between a 
client and therapist during therapy sessions, which can be a par-
ticularly challenging context. This methodology has the potential 
to provide new and valuable perspectives into behavior patterns 
across individuals, modalities, and time. 
2 PROPOSED MODEL 
Our approach to modeling behavior dynamics involves a three-step 
process. First, we introduce our novel multiview extension of latent 
change score models, which allows for the simultaneous capture 
of multimodal and interpersonal dynamics. We then demonstrate 
how these models are used to learn rich representations of behavior. 
Finally, we employ these representations as input for a predictive 
model, enabling us to make accurate predictions for practical im-
plementation. 
2.1 Multiview Latent Change Score Model 
A well-defned structure is essential for accurate and reliable struc-
tural equation model-based analysis. In this study, we extend the 
structure of latent change score models, a family of models that are

frequently used in psychological research for the study of longitudi-
nal data [42]. In particular, we defne a multiview latent change score 
model that allows us to simultaneously model patterns between 
modalities and individuals throughout an interaction. 
At the highest level, latent change score models are SEM struc-
tures that aim to estimate changes in a given variable over time. 
These models attempt to identify the underlying structure of these 
changes through the use of both observed variables and latent fac-
tors. From a machine learning perspective, these models resemble 
an approach that takes advantage of supervised and unsupervised 
techniques to analyze longitudinal data. By incorporating domain-
informed hypotheses about unobserved confounding factors (i.e., 
latent factors), these models help us better understand the relation-
ship between variables. 
The standard single-view latent change score model is illustrated 
in Figure 2c. Although the latent change score model can contain 
any number of measured time points (greater than two), the number 
of points to include is highly dependent on the available data [24, 
42]. In our case, we have a few diferent elements to consider. 
‚Ä¢ We need our chosen duration of  to be a reliable measure of 
behavior during that time interval, e.g., to ensure that both 
individuals have sufcient time for speaking and listening 
behavior during each segment. 
‚Ä¢ Based on our duration of  , we need to ensure that the 
duration of each complete sequence (duration( )√ó points ) 
allows a sufcient number of sample sequences to be drawn 
from the entire session to perform meaningful statistical 
modeling. 
‚Ä¢ We must ensure that we have enough time points per se-
quence to accurately estimate the free parameters in the 
model. 
To achieve these objectives, it is crucial to select an appropriate 
duration and quantity of  that balances the need for an accurate 
representation of individual behaviors with the need to maintain 
a suitable number of sample sequences and data points for robust 
statistical analysis. We selected a 45-second window for each time 
point  after evaluating the ft of the single view model on each of 
our behavior markers. Given this 45-second window, our average 
session duration of 50‚Äì60 minutes, and our models as specifed 
earlier, we decided to proceed with a three-point sequence (see sub-
section 3.1, Data Set). This decision results in having 60‚Äì80 input sequences per model, which is consistent with the typical sugges-
tion of 10‚Äì20 sequences per free parameter [24]. Therefore, the 
single-view model upon which we expand our analysis consists 
of a sequence of three observed variables and fve latent factors. 
We deconstruct this model into three ablation phases to defne and 
later demonstrate the signifcance of each component (see Figure 2 
for an illustration of each step). 
Step 1: Latent sequence (Figure 2a). The core of this model is 
the representation of longitudinal data in its most primitive stage. 
The basic implementation of a three-part sequential SEM consists 
of the three measured variables ( ,  +1, +2) loaded onto their 
respective latent factors ( , +1, +2). These loadings ( ) repre-
sent the degree to which the latent construct explains the variance 
of the measured variable. This connection encodes the hypothesis 
that each measurement is the sum of the ‚Äútrue‚Äù latent value plus 
some amount of measurement error (self-variance,  ). We con-
strain these loadings to be equivalent for each time point because 
we expect that this relationship will not change over time, and 
doing so will improve the estimation and interpretability of the 
model. The three latent factors are connected with one-way causal 
paths, suggesting that the value at each time point is infuenced 
by the value at the previous time point, along with the variance of 
the latent factor itself ( ). At this point, we can defne our model 
using the following equations. 
 =   +  (1) 
 +1 =   +1 +   +1 =   +  (2) 
 +2 =   +2 +   +2 =  +1 +  (3) 
Step 2: Intercept (Figure 2b). The next component that we add 
to the model is the sequence intercept (¬Ø). This intercept represents 
the value of a construct at the frst time point, serving as a baseline 
against which future values of the construct are compared. Neglect-
ing to include an intercept would represent the assumption that all 
sequences begin at the same value: an untenable premise. We can 
now defne our latent factors with the following equations; note 
that the measured variables ( ,  +1, +2) will retain the same 
defnition throughout. 
 = ¬Ø +  (4) 
 +1 =   + ¬Ø +  (5) 
 +2 =   +1 + ¬Ø +  (6)

unimodal models across behavioral markers, with statisti-
cally signifcant diferences annotated. Ablation across the 
sequence-only, added-intercept, and full variants of the la-
tent change score model (LCSM; Figure 2) suggests that the 
inclusion of each additional structural element improves the 
ft of the model. Note that head motion-based models exhibit 
a signifcantly poorer ft in a unimodal context compared to 
language-based models. 
Step 3: Latent change factors (Figure 2c). A defning element 
of the latent change score model is the inclusion of latent change 
factors (Œî +1, Œî +2). These second-order latent factors represent 
the change in the frst-order latent factors over time. Inclusion of 
these factors helps the model account for variability in the dynamics 
across individuals ‚Äî or, in our case, across diferent moments in 
the therapy session.

 +2 = ¬Ø + +1 + Œî +2 +  Œî +2 =  +1 + Œî (9) Figure 3 illustrates the ft achieved by the unimodal version of 
the model. In the case of this analysis, our objective is to simulate 
behavior dynamics between modalities and individuals during the 
interaction of a therapist and their client. Therefore, we extend 
the standard latent change score model by creating a multiview 
extension to incorporate multiple modalities and individuals in the 
analysis. 
Step 4: Multiview extension. The bivariate extension of the 
latent change score model enables the study of two forms of be-
havior dynamics over time, as well as cross-modal (Figure 4) or 
cross-individual (Figure 5) interactions between these temporal 
dynamics. For example, if the client starts nodding more frequently 
than before, does the therapist also begin nodding more than be-
fore? Is the client‚Äôs head motion related to the discussion about 
emotions? Inclusion of covariance parameters across latent con-
structs, intercepts, and change factors of diferent behaviors enables 
a deeper investigation of these research questions. 
Ultimately, however, our goal is to model the details of the tem-
poral behavior dynamics between modalities and individuals. To 
achieve this, we further extend the bivariate latent change score 
model to construct a multiview latent change score model. By inte-
grating cross-modal interactions and individual diferences, this 
multiview extension ofers valuable insight into the intricate pat-
terns of therapist-client interactions, facilitating a more nuanced 
understanding of the factors infuencing therapy outcomes. 
Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate statistical 
approach used to analyze complex relationships between latent 
and observed variables [ 16, 38]. Generally confrmatory in nature, 
SEM aims to test whether a hypothesized model fts a given dataset, 
involving the use of several mathematical equations describing a 
hypothesized structure of the data. This structure defnes a set of 
relationships between latent and observed variables, such as factor 
loadings, causal pathways, and covariance matrices. If the model 
fts the data well, its structure provides us with insight into the 
underlying driving behavior patterns in the data, while also tak-
ing into account measurement errors and potentially confounding 
factors. In general, SEM has become increasingly popular for inter-
disciplinary research due to its ability to capture complexity within 
systems without sacrifcing interpretability [49, 56, 62]. 
We selected this modeling technique over other traditional ma-
chine learning models for several reasons. The primary advantage 
we value is the interpretability of SEM, which provides more un-
derstandable and approachable explanations of the relationships 
between variables. SEM provides a graphical representation of the 
model that helps visualize complex relationships between factors. 
Furthermore, many popular black-box frameworks used in machine 
learning, such as deep neural networks, require large amounts of 
training data before producing meaningful results. In contrast, SEM 
can provide insight from smaller sample sizes with fewer observa-
tions since it combines data-driven parameter training with expert 
domain knowledge [33, 49]. This beneft is even more advantageous 
to our domain than most areas of multimodal research: the addi-
tional overhead and sensitivity required to collect rich multimodal 
behavior data, especially in healthcare, often leads to a smaller num-
ber of available observations than is available for other research 
areas.

2.2 Representation Learning 
The ultimate objective of the SEM framework is to minimize the 
diference between the covariance matrix observed in the data and 
the covariance matrix implied by the model. Consequently, the 
appropriate approximation of the covariance matrix is of vital im-
portance for our analysis. We note that the standard calculation of 
the covariance matrix is suboptimal for our use case: we cannot 
assume that our data are normally distributed (we would expect 
a long-tailed distribution), nor does our dataset contain an overly 
large number of observations (conventional wisdom suggests that 
the standard calculation requires 10‚Äì20√ó observations as the num-
ber of observed variables; [25, 39]). For these reasons, we turn to 
the asymptotic distribution-free covariance estimation method. 
The asymptotic distribution-free covariance matrix is calculated 
using Spearman‚Äôs rank coefcient, a nonparametric measure of 
correlation based on the order of values [63], in contrast to the 
standard calculation which uses the normality-assuming Pearson‚Äôs 
coefcient based on the raw values [46]. The method of asymptotic 
distribution-free covariance estimation has also been shown to 
improve the performance of covariance-based models when an 
analysis is limited by smaller data sets [43]. 
Our goal is to minimize the diference between this sample co-
variance matrix and the model-implied covariance matrix. The 
model-implied covariance matrix is calculated with 
Œ£ = Œõ( ‚àí 0)‚àí1Œ®(( ‚àí 0)‚àí1) Œõ + Œò, (10) 
where Œõ, Œò, Œ®, and 0 are the four parameter matrices that specify 
the model1. 
1Although much of the statistical literature presents SEM analyses in the fully-specifed 
‚ÄúLISREL‚Äù notation convention, we present our model in the abbreviated ‚Äúall-‚Äù con-
vention for simplicity and accessibility (see [27] for more information). For an SEM with  measured variables and  latent factors, 
these matrices are 
‚Ä¢ Factor loadings (Œõ), the regression coefcients of unobserved 
latent factors on observed measured variables, of shape  √ó 
 ; 
‚Ä¢ Residual variances of observed variables (Œò), including mea-
surement error, of shape  √ó  ; 
‚Ä¢ Variances and covariances of latent variables (Œ®), of shape 
 √ó  ; and 
‚Ä¢ Causal pathways (), representing causal relationships be-
tween latent variables, of shape  √ó  . 
The models were trained using the Adam optimization algo-
rithm [32] with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and the weighted 
squared error loss function as the minimization objective. We se-
lected the weighted squared error loss function because, unlike 
other common SEM loss functions, such as maximum likelihood, the 
squared error loss does not assume any normality of the data [33]. 
loss = (Œ£ ‚àí Œ£ )  ¬∑(Œ£ ‚àí Œ£ ) (11) 
In this case, the weight matrix is set to the inverse of the covariance 
matrix of the sample data ( = Œ£‚àí1). Using these weights is one 
way to place more emphasis on data with a smaller variance and 
less emphasis on data with a larger variance, to reduce the impact 
of observations with larger errors or greater uncertainty [20]. 
The training procedure was repeated multiple times with random 
initialization. In addition to improving the robustness of the model, 
drawing more samples from the distribution of parameter estimates 
helps us to defne a prior distribution for the second phase of our 
analysis (see section 3, Experimental Setup). By approximating a 
range of values rather than a singular value, we can preserve data

regarding the uncertainty of our parameter estimates. Retaining 
this uncertainty allows us to make more informed interpretations 
of the predictive model. 
2.3 Gaussian Process Regression 
For our study, we have emphasized the Gaussian process (GP) re-
gressor as our preferred predictor. It is relevant to note that, despite 
the ‚ÄòGaussian‚Äô name, GPs are not limited to modeling data believed 
to be drawn from an underlying Gaussian distribution. Instead, the 
name is derived from the fact that GPs learn each parameter esti-
mate as a Gaussian distribution [ 50]. This is in contrast to various 
contemporary machine learning models that typically approximate 
parameter estimates as fxed or point values. Incorporating uncer-
tainty into a model, similar to the benefts of structural equation 
modeling, can improve the robustness of the model when dealing 
with real-world data, which are often afected by measurement error 
and other noise. Furthermore, Gaussian process models possess the 
capability to efectively approximate nonlinear associations, as they 
are based on kernel functions. This attribute diferentiates them 
from other probability-based regression models, such as Bayesian 
regression, which are based on linear functions [18]. 
3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
In addition to simply applying structural equation models to our 
data, we also aim to demonstrate the practicality of these features. 
This is achieved by presenting a comparison of various predictive 
models that utilize said features to forecast the working alliance 
ratings of both therapist and client. The data used for this analysis 
is derived from the behavior of therapists and clients during ther-
apy sessions, specifcally their head motion and language features. Our ultimate objective is to use these markers to construct inter-
pretable predictive models that enable us to gain a more nuanced 
understanding of these underlying behavior dynamics. The results 
illustrate the utility of structural equation modeling as a form of 
representation learning for systems of behavior. 
3.1 Data Set 
The audiovisual recordings used in this analysis include 266 therapy 
sessions, with the participation of 39 unique clients and 11 unique 
therapists[ 58]. Each therapist worked with 3 to 5 diferent clients, 
each client attending 6 to 8 sessions that lasted between 40 and 
60 minutes. Therapy sessions were held in a private setting and 
recorded with the consent of the clients and the therapists. 
Participants were recruited from a research registry, printed 
material advertising the study, and personal referrals. For inclusion 
in the study, participants were required to be between 18 and 65 
years of age, meet the diagnostic standards for major depressive 
disorder according to DSM-5 [2], experience moderate or greater 
depressive symptoms (as indicated by a Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression score of 14 or higher; [26]), and be able and willing to 
provide informed consent. Individuals with comorbid psychotic 
disorders, active suicidal or homicidal ideation, chronic depressive 
symptoms, or current misuse of substances or alcohol were excluded 
from the study. Participants with suspected psychosis or active 
suicidal ideation with intent or a plan to harm themselves were 
referred to the psychiatric emergency room. 
3.1.1 Feature Extraction: Head Motion. Head motion features were 
extracted from patient and clinician videos using OpenFace [9]. The 
extracted features represented the total degree of head motion in 
radians for each axis (pitch, yaw, and roll) within that time window. 
Data were grouped by a window size of 45 seconds, which was 
522
Representation Learning for Interpersonal and Multimodal Behavior Dynamics ICMI ‚Äô23, October 09‚Äì13, 2023, Paris, France 
selected to guarantee a sufcient number of data points per session 
to attain acceptable statistical power in later analysis (see subsec-
tion 2.3; Gaussian Process Regression). 
To reduce tracking noise, two measures were implemented. First, 
frames that had a confdence level lower than 90% were eliminated2 
and linear interpolation was applied to fll the gaps, which was 
considered satisfactory given that the data were collected at a con-
sistent rate. To further reduce tracking noise, a Savitzky-Golay 
flter was utilized to smooth the data, as it is recognized to be more 
efective than a moving average flter in maintaining the original 
shape of the data given its polynomial ftting [55]. Implementing 
these measures ensured a cleaner and more reliable data set for 
analysis. 
3.1.2 Feature Extraction: Language Use. The audio recordings of 
the sessions were transcribed using a machine transcription ser-
vice [59]. From these transcripts, we extracted various lexical cate-
gories using the LIWC tool (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count; [47]), 
which has shown validity in measuring verbal dialogue and lan-
guage usage in multiple domains [15, 48, 54]. For this study, we 
focus on the use of fve particular lexical categories of language: 
‚Ä¢ negations, such as ‚Äúno‚Äù, ‚Äúnever‚Äù, and ‚Äúnot‚Äù; 
‚Ä¢ pronouns, such as ‚ÄúI‚Äù, ‚Äúthem‚Äù, and ‚Äúitself‚Äù; 
‚Ä¢ afective words, such as ‚Äúnervous‚Äù, ‚Äúugly‚Äù, and ‚Äúbitter‚Äù; 
‚Ä¢ positive emotions3, such as ‚Äúhappy‚Äù, ‚Äúpretty‚Äù, and ‚Äúgood‚Äù; and 
‚Ä¢ negative emotions3, such as ‚Äúhate‚Äù, ‚Äúworthless‚Äù, and ‚Äúenemy‚Äù. 
Existing literature has shown that these specifc linguistic cate-
gories are strong indicators of both an individual‚Äôs mental well-
being and interpersonal connections. Previous research has shown 
that overuse of negative words can cause increased tension be-
tween speakers [61]. However, negations can also be used to soften 
potentially adversarial or distressing statements during difcult 
conversations to preserve rapport [11]. The use of pronouns and 
positive emotion words tends to improve the listener‚Äôs perception 
of empathy, trust, or closeness [1, 23]. Negative emotion words can 
serve a similar purpose as negations: while often linked to social 
tension or negative communication spiraling at a broad level [5, 21], 
negative emotion words can also facilitate collaborative problem 
solving and understanding when communicated with respect and 
empathy [52]. 
3.1.3 Target Variable: Working Alliance Ratings. The working al-
liance in therapy refers to the collaborative relationship that devel-
ops between a therapist and the client throughout treatment and 
the degree to which they work together efectively [10]. A strong 
working alliance fosters trust and open communication between 
the client and the therapist, which is known to contribute to better 
therapeutic outcomes [29]. After the end of each therapy session, 
both the therapist and the client participants completed the thera-
pist and client versions of the short form of the Working Alliance 
Inventory (WAI-SR; [ 28, 30]), a widely used measure of alliance in 
therapy. The WAI consists of three subscales that measure the three 
distinct components of a working alliance: 
2Approximately 6% of video frames were excluded for low tracking confdence. 
3Note that positive emotion words and negative emotion words are subcategories of 
afective words. ‚Ä¢ the goal subscale, which evaluates the individual‚Äôs belief that 
participants agree on the overall objectives of the treatment; 
‚Ä¢ the task subscale, which evaluates the individual‚Äôs belief that 
participants agree on the steps required to achieve those 
goals; and 
‚Ä¢ the bond subscale, which evaluates the individual‚Äôs emo-
tional respect and trust for the other participant. 
Each subscale consists of statements that the individual rates on a 
fve-point Likert-type scale ranging from ‚Äúseldom true‚Äù to ‚Äúalways 
true‚Äù. The client version of the inventory contains 12 items, while 
the therapist version contains 10 items. For the purposes of this 
analysis, we combine the task and goal subscales due to very high 
correlation: these two subscales achieve Pearson‚Äôs correlation coef-
fcient of  = 0.96 between them.4 Representative items for each 
subscale are presented in Table 1. 
3.2 Baseline Models 
We select a small set of popular machine learning models to com-
pare: ElasticNet, support vector regression, random forests, and 
the Gaussian process regressor. We selected these algorithms for 
their ability to perform well on small data sets. We have particular 
interest in the Gaussian process regressor because it can incorpo-
rate the information about uncertainty in the parameter estimates 
from the structural equation model. We also compare our multi-
view LCSM-based feature set against other frequently-used sets 
of sequence features: aggregate features (entropy, mean changes, 
variance, etc. [14]), cross-correlation features, and the combination 
of aggregate and cross-correlation features. 
Model hyperparameters were automatically selected using a 
leave-one-therapist-out approach to reduce the risk of train-test 
data contamination. In this approach, each therapist ( = 11) acted 
once as the test set: all sessions conducted by that therapist were 
designated as the test set, while all other sessions were allocated to 
the training set. Validation for each fold was conducted in a similar 
manner within the training set, with one therapist‚Äôs sessions being 
used for validation and the remaining sessions used for training. 
Features were recalculated with every training run to prevent de-
pendence on values from the test set. Prediction performance was 
measured using the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric. One 
advantage of RMSE over some comparable metrics, such as the 
coefcient of determination 2, is that it is defned in the same 
units as the output variable ‚Äî in this case, working alliance ratings 
‚Äî and its stability in smaller data sets. 
Table 2 presents a comparison of the test-set performance for 
each prediction model. Results demonstrate that the multiview 
LCSM features perform at the same level or surpass other commonly-
used feature sets for temporal behavior analysis. 
3.3 Behavioral Dynamics Features 
The objective of our predictive models is to determine the extent to 
which the structure of the multimodal behavior dynamics during 
a therapy session can provide information on the strength of the 
overall working alliance shared by the client and the therapist. To 
achieve this, we propose a novel approach that incorporates the

parameters of the structural equation models, namely Œõ, Œ®, Œò, and 
, which were introduced and estimated in subsection 2.2, Rep-
resentation Learning. These parameters serve as a collection of 
computational metrics that allow us to quantify the behavior dy-
namics observed throughout each session. However, translating 
parameter estimates from one model into input features for another 
model presents an additional challenge, as the uncertainty infor-
mation provided by the initial model estimates is lost. Therefore, 
we must take some additional steps to integrate this uncertainty 
information obtained from the initial model estimates into the sub-
sequent model. 
In structural equation modeling, each parameter estimate is rep-
resented as a distribution that includes a central value and an esti-
mation of the standard error. This standard error serves to measure 
the accuracy of the parameter estimate and to indicate the degree 
of variability from the potential actual parameter value. Through 
multiple initializations of the models trained in section 2 (Proposed 
Model), a set of samples has been produced from the distribution 
of possible true parameter values, each with its own corresponding 
measure of confdence. The majority of models we present cannot 
take advantage of this data: however, the improved performance 
when it is provided to the Gaussian process regressor demonstrates 
its value (see Table 2). 
4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Our objective was to demonstrate the use of structural equation 
modeling as a means of representation learning for machine learn-
ing models. Our fndings indicate that the models display a reason-
able ft, the features constitute valuable information for prediction 
tasks, and we are now able to showcase the potential for interpre-
tation that this approach ofers. 
Table 3 presents the top three features, ranked by weight, for 
each of the target labels (task+goal ratings and bond ratings, each 
for both client and therapist). Some of the signifcant features are 
as expected, while others are not. For instance, we can observe that 
the client‚Äôs overall use of negative emotion words (the intercept; Ta-
ble 3c) is positively associated with the client‚Äôs bond rating. This 
could be due to the fact that clients who are more willing to express 
their negative emotions to the therapist may feel a stronger con-
nection with them, or that clients who feel more connected to the 
therapist may be more willing to share their negative emotions [6]. 
Additionally, we observe a that a stronger covariance between the 
use of pronouns by the therapist and the client‚Äôs nodding (Table 3b) 
is linked to higher ratings of task and goal by the therapist. Pronoun 
words, such as ‚ÄúI, you, they‚Äù, may indicate that when the therapist 
is discussing the client (‚Äúyou‚Äù) and the client nods, the therapist 
interprets this as a sign of agreement. However, we also note some 
unforeseen relationships. For instance, the covariance between the 
client‚Äôs nodding and the client‚Äôs use of negative emotion words 
is inversely related to the client‚Äôs assessment of the task and goal. 
Future work is necessary to determine the underlying reasons for 
this, but it is noteworthy to observe.

tional representations of behavior that integrate information from Vail et al.

multiple modalities, individuals, and time points. Our technique 
builds upon an existing structural equation modeling framework. 
Specifcally, we defne a multi-view extension of the latent change 
score model. Our analysis indicates that this structure does ft data 
well in our use case, suggesting that it is indeed fnding patterns 
in the data. We use the learned parameters of this model as input 
features for a secondary, predictive model, and demonstrate that 
the performance achieved using these features is comparable to

that achieved using than many classic features for this task. Our 
fndings demonstrate that learning features through this particu-
lar form of model training yields rich information about specifc 
areas of uncertainty, and that integration of this knowledge into 
models that are equipped to handle such information improves 
performance further. This approach to learning representations of 
multimodal, interpersonal, and temporal behavior creates novel 
opportunities for learning about and simulating human behavior.
