Past Projects
The BioASQ Challenge. From 2012 to 2016, a team led by LTI
Ph.D. student Zi Yang collaborated with
Hoffman-LaRoche's Innovation Center to develop information systems for
unstructured biomedical text, including a passage retrieval system for
the TREC Genomics dataset [1], a decision support system for gene
targeting which leverages information gathered from PubMed articles by
an automatic QA system [2], a Biomedical Semantic QA system which
received six 1st-place scores in the 2015
BioASQ Challenge tasks, which included snippet retrieval, concept
retrieval, and exact answer retrieval [3], and a Biomedical Semantic
QA system which received three 1st-place scores in exact answer
retrieval in the 2016
BioASQ Challenge [4]. In 2017, a team of CMU Ph.D and MS students focused on ideal answer (summary) questions in BioASQ, and received the best automatic evaluation score in
Task 5B [5].

The LiveQA Challenge. From 2015 to 2018, CMU collaborated with Yahoo! Labs (as part of the InMind project) to develop automatic answering agents that can respond to real-time questions from web users (like those received by the Yahoo! Answers community QA web site). CMU student Di Wang created a LiveQA system which combined standard retrieval algorithms (BM25) with state-of-the-art deep learning models [1] to achieve the highest score among all participants in the 2015 TREC LiveQA Challenge [2]. In 2016, Di extended his system to include a novel answer ranking method based on attentional encoder-decoder recurrent neural networks [3] and achieved the highest score among 25 automatic systems that were evaluated in the 2016 LiveQA Track [4]. Di continued to refine his approach and fielded the best automatic system for LiveQA medical questions in 2017 [5,6].

The Jeopardy! Challenge. From 2007 to 2011, CMU collaborated
with the IBM DeepQA Group
to develop an open-source framework for open advancement of question answering (OAQA) [1]. The initial OAQA
architecture and data model were used to build systems for the TREC
challenge problem and the Jeopardy! challenge problem [2,3,4,5].
Carnegie Mellon students Nico Schlaefer
and Hideki Shima also contributed
algorithms and code to IBM's Watson system, as participants in IBM's
summer internship program.
