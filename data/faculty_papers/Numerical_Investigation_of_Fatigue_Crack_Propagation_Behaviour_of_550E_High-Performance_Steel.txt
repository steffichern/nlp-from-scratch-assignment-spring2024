Abstract: The fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q550E high-performance steel (HPS) is studied in this paper. Static tensile testing and fatigue crack propagation testing were carried out, and the results were compared with those of Q235. Finite element models were developed and verified against the experimental results. The impacts of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pitting on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of the HPS were analysed. The results show that the fatigue life of Q550 was reduced by 18% due to the corrosion pitting, but it did not change the crack propagation path. When the stress intensity factor is higher than a certain value, the fatigue performance of Q235 is better than that of Q550E. The initial crack angle of 52.5° is the critical angle of the crack stress intensity factor. The steel tends to fracture as the crack depth ratio increases, and more attention should be paid to the effective crack length in engineering practice. An increasing stress ratio leads to a smaller stress intensity factor, and the thickness affects the stress intensity factor in the later stage. The crack stress intensity factor around the corrosion pits gradually decreases along the thickness direction, and the crack tips around the corrosion pits tend to reach the yield state initially, accelerating the fatigue fracture of the specimen and ultimately leading to a decrease in fatigue life.

Abstract: The fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q550E high-performance steel (HPS) is studied
in this paper. Static tensile testing and fatigue crack propagation testing were carried out, and the
results were compared with those of Q235. Finite element models were developed and veriﬁed
against the experimental results. The impacts of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio,
thickness, and corrosion pitting on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of the HPS were analysed.
The results show that the fatigue life of Q550 was reduced by 18% due to the corrosion pitting, but it
did not change the crack propagation path. When the stress intensity factor is higher than a certain
value, the fatigue performance of Q235 is better than that of Q550E. The initial crack angle of 52.5is
the critical angle of the crack stress intensity factor. The steel tends to fracture as the crack depth ratio
increases, and more attention should be paid to the effective crack length in engineering practice. An
increasing stress ratio leads to a smaller stress intensity factor, and the thickness affects the stress
intensity factor in the later stage. The crack stress intensity factor around the corrosion pits gradually
decreases along the thickness direction, and the crack tips around the corrosion pits tend to reach
the yield state initially, accelerating the fatigue fracture of the specimen and ultimately leading to a
decrease in fatigue life.

1. Introduction
Bridge structures are developing in the direction of large span, high load, light
weight, and environmental protection [ 1]. The performance of steel is also improving
with the increasing demands of engineering construction, resulting in high-performance
steel for bridges [ 2,3]. Compared to ordinary steel, high-performance steel (HPS) shows
higher strength, higher fracture toughness, and better fatigue resistance [ 4–7]. As a result,
HPS is widely used in various steel bridges [ 8], such as the sea-crossing bridge, Akashi
Kaikyo Bridge.
Long-term stress fatigue often leads to structural fracture failure during the service life
of steel bridges [ 9–12]. Zong et al. [ 13] conducted an experimental study on the fatigue crack
growth rate of Q345qD bridge steel by changing its thicknesses and stress ratios. The results
showed that the crack growth rate increased with the stress ratio, and the crack growth
rate increased by 7–25%, but the inﬂuence of plate thickness change was not noticeable.
Liu et al. [ 14] studied the relationship between the thickness and the stress state of the
crack, quantiﬁed the thickness effect, and introduced the penetrating crack, but how the
thickness affects the stress intensity factor of the crack tip was not clearly pointed out [ 15].
Li et al. [ 16] carried out a study on the inﬂuence of different surface crack directions on
Metals 2023 ,13, 1496. https://doi.org/10.3390/met13081496 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/metals

the change in stress intensity factor during bearing operation. Yaagoubi and Meier [ 17]
studied the relationship between surface cracks with different angles and the J-integral,
and they showed that the increase in friction effect in the case of oblique cracks weakened
the J-integral at the crack tip. But there has been no in-depth study on penetrating cracks,
which are more harmful to the structure; these will be studied in this paper for HPS steel.
Although the effective initial crack in the process of crack propagation is very short, it is
extremely destructive since there are some invisible initial cracks. Therefore, it is necessary
to undertake in-depth study on the crack depth ratio. Meanwhile, most scholars have
focused on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of ordinary steel beams [ 18,19], and
there have been insufﬁcient investigations on fatigue crack failure of high-performance
steel. Kang and Hong [ 20] studied the fatigue properties of HPS, and their results showed
that the fatigue strength of Q690D HPS was signiﬁcantly higher than existing speciﬁcations.
It is known that the joint action of a corrosive environment and repeated stress is one
of the main reasons for the premature failure of most engineering metals, especially in
marine environments [ 21,22]. This usually leads to the premature initiation of fatigue cracks
on the surface of materials, resulting in reductions in fatigue life and resistance [ 23–25].
The research on the crack growth rate of different kinds of steels is extensive [ 26], but the
driving factors affecting the crack growth rate of HPS are not well understood [ 27–29]. The
effects of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion
pitting have not attracted enough attention, but they are very important for the fatigue
safety of high-performance steel structures [ 30]. These limited investigations have led to
fatigue safety problems in high-performance steel structures.
To investigate the behaviour of fatigue crack propagation, a ﬁnite element model of
a CT specimen of Q550E HPS is established and veriﬁed against experimental results in
this paper. The impacts of the initial crack angle, crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness,
and corrosion pit on crack propagation are studied. This research provides a reliable and
practical basis for the theoretical analysis of prefabricated cracks and an anti-fatigue design,
which promotes the application of HPS in sea-crossing bridges.

2.1. Specimen Design
Q550E with a thickness of 8 mm was used in the experiment, and Q235 specimens
were also made for comparison. The chemical compositions of the steels are shown in
Table 1. In order to obtain accurate material parameters of the tensile mechanical properties
of the steel, uniaxial tensile tests were carried out before the fatigue crack propagation
experiments, and the test results are shown in Table 2.

by the COD extensometer, and the fatigue cr ack length was calculated using the formula 
of the ﬂexibility method. In order to ensure that  the crack tip was sharp enough and not 
aﬀected by the initial notch shape of machining, a 1.5 mm crack was prefabricated via 
initial machine cu tting. In general, the stress intensity factor K୫ୟ୶ selected for pre-crack-
ing was higher than the value in the crack growth rate test. If there was no crack initiation after 30–50 thousand cycles, the K

concentration when the crack tip extends to the vicinity of the corrosion pit, which leads to
a sudden increase in stress at the crack tip, thus accelerating the crack propagation. The
crack propagation life of Q550E was reduced by about 18% from the intact sample to the
corroded one. However, the corrosion pit had little inﬂuence on the crack propagation curve
path, shown in Figure 6; the crack propagation path is along the direction perpendicular to
the load line.

Figure 7 shows the crack growth rates of the two steels according to their average
values, and an intersection point at a stress intensity factor amplitude of 24.04 MPam1/2
can be observed. After this point, the crack growth rate of Q550E is slightly higher than
that of Q235. As shown in this ﬁgure, the crack growth rates of the corroded specimens
can be roughly divided into three stages in the logarithmic coordinate system, i.e., Stage
I of initial crack growth, Stage II of the crack passing through the pit, and Stage III of
stable crack growth. When the crack growth length reaches 12 mm, the crack reaches the
edge of the corrosion pit, and the crack growth rate then suddenly changes and enters
Stage II. When the crack length reaches 16mm, the crack propagation completely passes
through the corrosion pit, and the crack propagation of the specimen reaches a stable
stage. The fatigue crack propagation rate is linearly related to the stress intensity factor
in the logarithmic coordinate system. The crack growth rate of Q550E in Zones I and II is
signiﬁcantly higher than that of Q235. Once the crack propagates through the corrosion pit,
the crack propagation rate of Q550E is slightly higher.

4.1. Finite Element Model
A ﬁnite element model was developed by using the commercial software ANSYS
workbench. The specimen size, material parameters, and load of the ﬁnite element model
were consistent with those of the crack propagation test. A tetrahedral mesh and Solid185 el-
ements were adopted, and the overall mesh accuracy was set to 1.5 mm. For a more realistic
simulation and considering the requirements of time and accuracy, an inﬂuence ball with a
radius of 6 mm and a mesh precision of 0.4 mm was set at the crack tip for mesh reﬁnement,
as shown in Figure 8. Smart crack growth simulation was adopted in the mesh processing.
This process is based on mesh division that simulates the features of fatigue or crack growth
morphology in engineering structures, representing separation, deformation, adaptation,
and re-division technology. To simulate static or dynamic fatigue crack growth in the
solution process, the inﬂuence of the crack tip stress singularity on the crack growth rate
can be effectively alleviated. Because the grid changes occur at the crack front, the stress
state at the crack tip can be well represented in the process of crack propagation, and the
high stress intensity factor at the crack tip caused by rough grid division can be avoided.

on the crack growth rate can be e ﬀectively alleviated. Because the grid changes occur at 
the crack front, the stress state at the crack tip can be well represented in the process of 
crack propagation, and the high stress intensity factor at the crack tip caused by rough grid division can be avoided.

4.2. Veriﬁcation
The results of the ﬁnite element simulation were compared with the corresponding
experimental values, as shown in Figure 10. The maximum errors of the intact Q550E and
Q235 in terms of a–N curves in Figure 10a were 6.53% and 3.4%, respectively. The maximum
errors of Q550E and Q235 with corrosion pitting were 9.17% and 8.94%, respectively. Due
to the grid division of the crack tip, the error of the specimens with corrosion pitting is
relatively high, but the overall error is small, which can truly reﬂect the crack propagation
of CT specimens. Figure 10b shows the crack propagation path, and it can be seen that
the experimental value is very close to the simulated value in terms of crack length and
angle. Therefore, the developed ﬁnite element model was deemed reliable for further
parameter analysis.

4.3. Parametric Analysis
4.3.1. Initial Crack Angle
To study the effect of the initial crack angle on the crack propagation, initial cracks at
four angles of 0, 30, 45, and 60were prefabricated on the specimens in this study. The
initial crack length was 1.5 mm with a 7 kN load level, thickness of 8 mm, and stress ratio
of 0.1.
As shown in Figure 11, the trends of crack propagation at different angles were the
same. The curves are very close to each other when the initial angles are in the range
of0–45, but they change signiﬁcantly at 60. Thus, there is a critical angle of crack
propagation. An encrypted approximation at 45–60was carried out. It was found that
the critical angle was 52.5, where the crack growth rate suddenly changed. According to
theK–N curve, with an increase in the initial crack propagation angle, the stress intensity
factor caused by crack tip fracture decreases, and the reduction range is as high as 59%.
Therefore, an initial crack angle of 0is the most unfavourable for crack propagation. The
initial crack angle has little effect on the K–arelationship.

4.3.1. Initial Crack Angle 
To study the e ﬀect of the initial crack angle on the crack propagation, initial cracks at 
four angles of 0°, 30°, 45°, and 60° were pref abricated on the specimens in this study. The 
initial crack length was 1.5 mm with a 7 kN load level, thickness of 8 mm, and stress ratio 
of 0.1. 
As shown in Figure 11, the trends of crack propagation at di ﬀerent angles were the 
same. The curves are very close to each other when the initial angles  are in the range of 
0°–45°, but they change signi ﬁcantly at 60°. Thus, there is a critical angle of crack propa-
gation. An encrypted approximation at 45°–60° was carried out. It was found that the crit-
ical angle was 52.5°, where the crack growth  rate suddenly changed. According to the K–
N curve, with an increase in the initial crack propagation angle, the stress intensity factor 
caused by crack tip fracture decreases, and th e reduction range is as high as 59%. There-
fore, an initial crack angle of 0° is the most unfavourable for crack propagation. The initial 
crack angle has li ttle eﬀect on the K–a relationship.

4.3.2. Crack Depth Ratio
Figure 12 shows the crack growth life curves with six crack depth ratios for a thickness
of 8 mm and a stress ratio of 0.1. The fatigue life decreased with increasing depth ratio.
When the crack depth ratio was repeatedly increased by 0.05, the fatigue life decreased by
37%, 39%, 49%, 40%, and 54%. The relationship curve between the stress intensity factor
and crack length was not affected by the crack depth ratio. The change in the stress ratio
did not affect the cracking state under the same crack depth ratio, as shown in Figure 12c.
The ratio of the cracking Kto the stress ratio R was constant for different crack depth ratios,
and the ratio became higher as the depth increased.

stress ratio did not a ﬀect the cracking state under the same crack depth ratio, as shown in

4.3.3. Stress Ratio  
Previous studies have shown that stress ratios of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 can well demon-
strate the e ﬀect of stress ratios on crack propagation [24]. For this reason, these stress ratios 
with a thickness of 10 mm and a load of 36 kN  were used in the FEM to study the rela-
tionship between the crack propagation length, cycle times, and the K value.  
As shown in Figure 14, whether the steel is co rroded or not, the stress ratio is directly 
proportional to the crack length and inversely proportional to the stress intensity factor. 
The curves of corroded specimens ﬂuctuated and experienced a sharp–slow–sharp 
growth process. This is because the e ﬀective length of the crack tip decreases when the 
crack propagation length is about to reach th e corrosion pit. This leads to a sudden in-
crease in crack tip stress and, in turn, to a sudden change in the crack propagation rate.

Previous studies have shown that stress ratios of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 can well demon-
strate the effect of stress ratios on crack propagation [ 24]. For this reason, these stress
ratios with a thickness of 10 mm and a load of 36 kN were used in the FEM to study the
relationship between the crack propagation length, cycle times, and the Kvalue.
As shown in Figure 14, whether the steel is corroded or not, the stress ratio is directly
proportional to the crack length and inversely proportional to the stress intensity factor.
The curves of corroded specimens ﬂuctuated and experienced a sharp–slow–sharp growth
process. This is because the effective length of the crack tip decreases when the crack
propagation length is about to reach the corrosion pit. This leads to a sudden increase in
crack tip stress and, in turn, to a sudden change in the crack propagation rate.
4.3.4. Thickness
According to ASTM E647-15, the thickness B of the CT specimen should be between
W⁄20 and W ⁄4. Considering the information in the related literature [ 24], steel samples with
thicknesses of 5 mm, 8 mm, and 10 mm with a load of 7 kN and a stress ratio of 0.1 were
used to study the effect of thickness on the crack propagation.
As shown in Figure 15, an increase in thickness leads to a downward curve shift in the
K–arelationship, which shows that the thickness is inversely proportional to K. When the
thickness was 10mm, the variation in Kwas the lowest, and the extreme difference occurred
at 595.18 MPamm1/2. For the K–N curves, the stress intensity factors at the initial fracture
Metals 2023 ,13, 1496 13 of 18
of the crack tip for these thicknesses were 923.96 MPamm1/2, 589.01 MPamm1/2, and
482.32 MPamm1/2, respectively. Obviously, halving the thickness from 10 mm to 5 mm led
to an increase in K. The numbers of cycles that began to develop rapidly when the thickness
reached 8 mm and 10 mm were roughly 133,761 and 335,330, respectively. This indicates
that a smaller stress intensity factor of crack tip fracture appears when the thickness is
greater, and the critical value of rapid fracture cycles gradually increases, that is, the steel is
less likely to fracture. In the a–N relationship, increasing the thickness resulted in a lower
crack growth rate. For the same number of cycles, the extension length decreases as the
thickness increases. Therefore, as the thickness increases, the Kvalue of the crack tip at the
stress concentration position reaches a maximum. Combined with the theoretical formula
forK, the thickness affects Kin the crack propagation area and signiﬁcantly affects the crack
growth rate. The stress intensity factor changes little in the early stage of crack propagation,
but it changes obviously in the later stage.

W⁄20 and W ⁄4. Considering the information in the related literature [24], steel samples 
with thicknesses of 5 mm, 8 mm, and 10 mm with a load of 7 kN and a stress ratio of 0.1 
were used to study the e ﬀect of thickness on the crack propagation. 
As shown in Figure 15, an increase in thickness leads to a downward curve shift in 
the K–a relationship, which shows that the thickness is inversely proportional to K. When 
the thickness was 10mm, the variation in K was the lowest, and the extreme di ﬀerence 
occurred at 595.18 MPa ∙ mmଵ/ଶ. For the K–N curves, the stress intensity factors at the ini-
tial fracture of the crack tip for these thicknesses were 923.96 MPa ∙ mmଵ/ଶ, 589.01 MPa ∙
mmଵ/ଶ, and 482.32 MPa ∙ mmଵ/ଶ, respectively. Obviously, halving the thickness from 10 
mm to 5 mm led to an increase in K. The numbers of cycles that began to develop rapidly 
when the thickness reached 8 mm and 10 mm were roughly 133,761 and 335,330, respec-
tively. This indicates that a smaller stress intensity factor of crack tip fracture appears 
when the thickness is greater, and the critical value of rapid fracture cycles gradually in-
creases, that is, the steel is less likely to fracture. In the  a–N relationship, increasing the 
thickness resulted in a lower crack growth rate. For the same number of cycles, the exten-
sion length decreases as the thickness increase s. Therefore, as the thickness increases, the 
K value of the crack tip at the stress concen tration position reaches a maximum. Combined 
with the theoretical formula for K, the thickness a ﬀects K in the crack propagation area 
and signi ﬁcantly aﬀects the crack growth rate. The st ress intensity factor changes li ttle in 
the early stage of crack propagation, but it changes obviously in the later stage. 9 1 21 51 82 12 430060090012001500K/(MPa ⋅mm1/2)

4.3.5. Corrosion Pitting
Based on the research described above, a corrosion pit was prefabricated on the crack
propagation line. Studies have shown that there are many forms of corrosion pit, such as
conical, cylindrical, elliptical, and hemispherical, of which hemispherical corrosion pits
are the most widely used [ 32]. Therefore, a hemispherical corrosion pit with a radius
of 2 mm was prefabricated on the specimens based on the existing research [ 31]. The
sine wave continuous load reduction method was adopted to prefabricate an initial 2 mm
fatigue crack. The data of the ﬁrst 2 mm of the initial crack are relatively discrete in the
formal propagation process; thus, the centre of the pit was positioned 4 mm away from the
crack tip of the specimen. The effects of various pit depths on the crack propagation were
analysed for cases of 0.25 B, 0.5 B, and 0.75 B (relative to CT specimen thickness B, namely,
1:1, 2:1, and 3:1).
As shown in Figure 16, before the crack propagation length reaches 12 mm, the
corrosion pits do not affect the fatigue life. Then, when the front line of the crack reaches
the edge of the pit, the crack propagation rate begins to increase slowly. When the crack
propagation length reaches 16 mm, that is, the crack passes through the bottom of the pit,
the crack propagation rate increases signiﬁcantly. Therefore, the corrosion pit has little
effect on the crack propagation in the early stage of the corrosion pit (less than 12 mm),
and the fatigue life of the specimen is obviously different when the crack passes through
the corrosion pit. The maximum difference in fatigue life was 29,252 times when passing
through the corrosion pit, accounting for 19% of the total life.

 4.3.5. Corrosion Pi tting 
Based on the research described above, a corrosion pit was prefabricated on the crack 
propagation line. Studies have shown that there are many forms of corrosion pit, such as conical, cylindrical, elliptical, and hemisphe rical, of which hemispherical corrosion pits 
are the most widely used [32]. Therefore, a he mispherical corrosion pit with a radius of 2 
mm was prefabricated on the specimens based on the existing research [31]. The sine wave 
continuous load reduction method was adopted to prefabricate an initial 2 mm fatigue 
crack. The data of the ﬁrst 2 mm of the initial crack are relatively discrete in the formal 
propagation process; thus, the centre of the pit was positioned 4 mm away from the crack 
tip of the specimen. The e ﬀects of various pit depths on the crack propagation were ana-
lysed for cases of 0.25 B, 0.5 B, and 0.75 B (relative to CT specimen thickness B, namely, 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1). 
As shown in Figure 16, before the crack propagation length reaches 12 mm, the cor-
rosion pits do not a ﬀect the fatigue life. Then, when the front line of the crack reaches the 
edge of the pit, the crack propagation rate begins to increase slowly. When the crack prop-
agation length reaches 16 mm, that is, the crack passes through the bo ttom of the pit, the 
crack propagation rate increases signi ﬁcantly. Therefore, the corrosion pit has li ttle eﬀect 
on the crack propagation in the early stage of the corrosion pit (less than 12 mm), and the 
fatigue life of the sp ecimen is obviously di ﬀerent when the crack passes through the cor-
rosion pit. The maximum di ﬀerence in fatigue life was 29, 252 times when passing through 
the corrosion pit, accounting for 19% of the total life.

Since the crack growth rate for the case wi th a depth of 0.75 B was the fastest, the 
change in K along the crack propagation direction wa s further studied. As shown in Figure 
17, stress ﬂuctuation occurs when the crack propag ates to the vicinity of the pit bo ttom 
because of the in ﬂuence of stress singularity. However, the K value of the crack tip at the 
bottom of the corrosion pit is always signi ﬁcantly higher than the value at both ends. The 
crack propagation rate reaches its maximum when it propagates to the bo ttom of the pit. 
From the perspective of the whole crack tip sect ion, when the crack tip extends to the left 
edge of the pit, the K of the crack tip near the pit edge is the highest. This is di ﬀerent from 
the distribution of K at the crack tip of the non-corroded specimen. This shows that the

5. Conclusions 
In this study, the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q550E high-performance 
steel was experimentally investigated. The fa tigue crack growth performance of Q550 was 
compared with that of Q235. The e ﬀects of some factors, such as the initial crack angle, 
crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pi tting, on crack propagation were 
numerically studied. The main conclusions of this study are as follows: 
1. The crack growth rate of Q550E is obviously higher than that of Q235 in the late stage 
of crack growth. The crack propagation life of Q550E is reduced by about 18% when corroded, as compared to intact specimens.  The crack growth curve associated with 
corrosion pi tting is divided into three stages, but it has li ttle in ﬂuence on the crack 
propagation path. 
2. A higher crack depth ratio easily leads to a higher K value, which, in turn, a ﬀects the 
structural life. The critical angle in the initial crack propagation process is 52.5°, and K is signi ﬁcantly aﬀected by the initial crack angle once this critical value is exceeded. 
When the initial crack angle is 0°, the crack tip stress is maximized, and fractures are

In this study, the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q550E high-performance 
steel was experimentally investigated. The fa tigue crack growth performance of Q550 was 
compared with that of Q235. The e ﬀects of some factors, such as the initial crack angle, 
crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pi tting, on crack propagation were

5. Conclusions
In this study, the fatigue crack propagation behaviour of Q550E high-performance
steel was experimentally investigated. The fatigue crack growth performance of Q550 was
compared with that of Q235. The effects of some factors, such as the initial crack angle,
crack depth ratio, stress ratio, thickness, and corrosion pitting, on crack propagation were
numerically studied. The main conclusions of this study are as follows:
1. The crack growth rate of Q550E is obviously higher than that of Q235 in the late stage
of crack growth. The crack propagation life of Q550E is reduced by about 18% when
corroded, as compared to intact specimens. The crack growth curve associated with
corrosion pitting is divided into three stages, but it has little inﬂuence on the crack
propagation path.
2. A higher crack depth ratio easily leads to a higher Kvalue, which, in turn, affects
the structural life. The critical angle in the initial crack propagation process is 52.5,
and Kis signiﬁcantly affected by the initial crack angle once this critical value is
exceeded. When the initial crack angle is 0, the crack tip stress is maximized, and
fractures are most likely to occur. Otherwise, the crack initiation angle tends to expand
perpendicular to the load direction.
3. The stress ratio is directly proportional to the crack length and inversely proportional
to the stress intensity factor. The thickness has an obvious impact on the Kvalue in
the crack propagation area and signiﬁcantly affects the crack growth rate.
4. The presence of a corrosion pit has little effect on crack propagation in the early stage
of the corrosion pit, but the fatigue life of the specimen is obviously different when the
crack passes through the corrosion pit. The corrosion pit around the crack propagation
surface reaches the yield state ﬁrst, and the Kvalue around the corrosion pit gradually
decreases along the thickness direction.
It should be noted that these ﬁndings are based on limited experimental and numerical
results. The comprehensive inﬂuence of these parameters needs to be veriﬁed and quanti-
ﬁed to further promote the application of Q550E in sea-crossing bridges. Therefore, more
studies are required to develop a fatigue life model with consideration of these parameters
for the guidance of HPS service performance evaluation in marine environments.
