 Continuous-time finance is a mathematical framework used in finance and economics to model financial markets where prices change continuously over time. This theory was first developed in the mid-20th century, specifically in the 1950s and 1960s, as an extension of discrete-time models such as those based on Markov processes. Some key contributions to the development of continuous-time finance came from researchers such as Paul Samuelson, Robert Merton, Myron Scholes, and Fischer Black.  One of the most influential works in this area is the Black-Scholes-Merton model for option pricing, which was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This model relies on continuous-time finance principles to derive a closed-form solution for the price of European call and put options under certain assumptions.  So, while it is difficult to pinpoint an exact starting point for continuous-time finance due to its evolution from earlier discrete-time models, we can say that significant developments in this field began in the mid-20th century.

 Architectural lighting design is a multidisciplinary field that typically begins during the early stages of building design and construction. The exact timing can depend on various factors, such as the size and complexity of the project, the involvement of the lighting designer in the team, and the project delivery method.  In an ideal scenario, an architectural lighting designer is brought on board at the initial conceptual stage of a project to collaborate with the architect, interior designer, engineer, and other stakeholders. At this stage, they can help establish the project's overall vision, including the desired mood, function, and aesthetics of the space, as well as identify any unique challenges that may require specialized lighting solutions.  However, in some cases, lighting design may not be incorporated until later in the process, such as during the construction documentation or even post-construction phases. In these situations, the designer may need to work more reactively to address specific issues or to integrate lighting into an existing space.  Regardless of when it starts, good architectural lighting design requires careful planning and collaboration with other professionals involved in the project. It is essential to involve a lighting designer as early as possible to ensure that the lighting contributes optimally to the overall success of the building.

Here are some common ways units can be referred to:  1. **Units of measurement**: Complex analysis does not have a fixed number of units of measurement since it's a theoretical field of mathematics and doesn't involve physical quantities. 2. **Course units**: Complex Analysis is typically taught as an advanced undergraduate or graduate-level university course. The number of units (or credits) awarded for completing such a course can vary from institution to institution, but it often ranges between 3 to 6 semester hours in the US system.  Therefore, based on your question, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer as to how many "units" Complex Analysis has.
 Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales. It is not restricted to any particular field or material, but rather provides a framework for understanding the physical properties of all materials at the quantum level.  The application of quantum mechanics to the study of materials is often referred to as "Quantum Mechanics of Materials" or "Condensed Matter Quantum Mechanics." This field combines principles from quantum mechanics with those from solid-state physics and material science, and it is an active area of research in modern physics and chemistry.  There isn't a specific start date for this field as it has evolved over several decades, with significant developments starting in the late 1920s and early 1930s when quantum mechanics was first being developed. Some key milestones include the development of the Schrödinger equation (1926), the discovery of electron spin (1925), and the explanation of the metallic behavior of metals using free electrons (1930).  Since then, there have been numerous advances in both theoretical and experimental techniques that have deepened our understanding of materials at the quantum level. Some of the most notable developments include: * The development of band theory and the understanding of semiconductors and insulators * The discovery of high-temperature superconductors in the late 1980s * The invention of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and related techniques for imaging the atomic structure of materials * The development of density functional theory (DFT), a computational method for predicting the electronic properties of materials.  Overall, Quantum Mechanics of Materials is an ongoing research area that continues to push the boundaries of our understanding of the physical world and has important applications in fields such as electronics, energy storage and conversion, and nanotechnology.

 The term "Institutions of the Roman Church" is often used to refer to a body of early Christian and Roman Catholic doctrines, practices, and organizational structures. It's important to note that this is not a distinct entity with a clear beginning or end. Instead, it represents a complex historical development spanning many centuries.  The term "Institutions of the Roman Church" can be traced back to the early Christian community in Rome and its evolution into the Roman Catholic Church over several centuries. However, the exact point at which we can say that this historical process came to an end is not clearly defined.  There are several events that could be considered as potential endpoints, but none of them mark a definitive closing of the "Institutions of the Roman Church" as such:  1. The Great Schism of 1054 AD, which marked the formal split between the Eastern Orthodox and Western (Roman Catholic) Churches. However, this did not mean an end to the development of Roman Catholic doctrine and practice. 2. The Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, which led to the establishment of various Protestant denominations and further diversification within Christianity. Again, however, this did not put an end to the evolution of Roman Catholic teachings and structures. 3. The First Vatican Council (1869-70) and the Second Vatican Council (1962-65), which brought significant reforms and modernizations to the Roman Catholic Church. While these councils marked important turning points in the history of the Church, they did not signify an end to its development. 4. The present day, as the Roman Catholic Church continues to evolve in response to changing social, political, and cultural circumstances.  In summary, there is no clear-cut answer to when "Institutions of the Roman Church" ended because this historical process has continued through various stages of development up until the present day.

 Project management does not have an end point in the same way that a project itself does not exist indefinitely. A project is typically defined by a specific goal or set of goals to be achieved within a certain time frame and budget. Once those goals have been met, and all deliverables have been completed and accepted, the project is considered closed or complete. At this point, the project team may disband, and the ongoing operations or maintenance of the product or service produced by the project would be handled by other teams or departments.  However, it's important to note that project management doesn't completely end there. The lessons learned from the project should be documented and shared with the organization for future projects. Additionally, any post- project support or maintenance required could still fall under the purview of project management, depending on the organizational structure.  Therefore, while a project may have an identifiable end point, project management itself continues to evolve and provide value to the organization.

 Organic chemistry of polymers is a subdiscipline of both organic chemistry and polymer science. The exact start of the study of organic chemistry of polymers can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when the first synthetic polymers, such as Bakelite and polyvinyl chloride, were developed. However, systematic research in this area gained momentum in the mid-20th century with the development of modern polymerization techniques, characterization methods, and theoretical frameworks.  In academic terms, a typical undergraduate organic chemistry course may not cover polymers extensively, if at all. Instead, students may be introduced to the basics of polymer chemistry in a dedicated polymer science or materials science course. Graduate programs in organic chemistry, polymer science, and materials science often include courses specifically focused on the synthesis, characterization, and properties of organic polymers.  Therefore, if you are interested in studying organic chemistry of polymers at the undergraduate level, I would recommend looking for a course titled "Polymer Chemistry," "Materials Science," or a similar course offering in your academic institution. At the graduate level, you can consider pursuing a degree in polymer science, materials science, or organic chemistry with a focus on polymers.
