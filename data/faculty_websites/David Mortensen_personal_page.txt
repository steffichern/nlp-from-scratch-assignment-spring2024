Language Technologies Institute, which is part of Carnegie Mellon Universityâs School of Computer Science. Before coming to CMU, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Pittsburgh.
I am currently developing a course on computational models of language below the level of the word.
For more about me, see my curriculum vitae.
Along with Lori Levin, I lead LLab, the LTI linguistics lab.
