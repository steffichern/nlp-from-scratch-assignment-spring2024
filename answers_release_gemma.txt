The tldr of the paper "Multimodal Fusion Interactions: A Study of Human and Automatic Quantification" is as follows:  The paper studies the problem of quantifying multimodal fusion interactions, which involves understanding how each modality individually provides information useful for a task and how this information changes in the presence of other modalities. The paper proposes three categorizations of multimodal interactions: partial labels, counterfactual labels, and information decomposition. The paper finds that information decomposition is a reliable alternative to conventional methods for studying multimodal interactions, especially for objective tasks. However, counterfactual labels may be more appropriate for subjective tasks. The paper also proposes a method to automatically convert annotations of partial and counterfactual labels to information decomposition, which can be used to estimate interaction values accurately and efficiently.
