Authors: Yiming Yang, Di Jia
Abstract: Compared to the charge–charge interaction, the role of the dipole‐dipole interaction has long been ignored in the phase behaviors of charged macromolecules in solutions. Charged macromolecules in solutions exhibit rich phase behaviors due to their complexity and they have been studied extensively. Phase separation can happen for charged macromolecules in the presence of monovalent salt, multivalent salt, and oppositely charged polymers, surfactants, etc., and for more advanced charged macromolecules such as polyzwitterions and polyampholytes, the phase diagram is even richer. In this perspective, the unacknowledged role of dipole‐dipole interaction in the phase behaviors of charged macromolecular solutions will be introduced. Dipolar polymers can form complex, self‐regulating structures which can be employed in various fields from drug‐delivery systems to next‐generation polymers. More importantly, it will shed light on how some of the life's basic and coherent structures such as biomolecular condensates and membrane‐less organelles are assembled and built by charged biomacromolecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins.
