Sure, here is the summary of the contents of "When to generate hedges in peer-tutoring interactions":  The paper explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict where hedging occurs in peer-tutoring interactions. The study uses a naturalistic face-to-face dataset annotated for natural language turns, conversational strategies, tutoring strategies, and nonverbal behaviors. The results show that embedding layers, capturing the semantic information of the previous turns, significantly improves the model’s performance. Additionally, the study provides insights into the importance of various features, such as interpersonal rapport and nonverbal behaviors, in predicting hedges. The paper also discovers that the eye gaze of both the tutor and the tutee has a significant impact on hedge prediction.

Sure, here is a summary of the text provided in "Identification_of_Nonlinear_Latent_Hierarchical_Models":  The text describes a novel identifiability theory for nonlinear latent hierarchical models. The main contributions of the work include:  * Analogous to independence tests in PC algorithm [Spirtes et al., 2000] and rank- deficiency tests in Huang et al. [2022], the author develops a novel identifiability theory (Theorem 3.2) as a fundamental criterion for locating and identifying latent variables in general nonlinear causal models. * The author shows structure identification guarantees for latent hierarchical models admitting continuous multi-dimensional (c.f., one-dimensional and often discrete [Pearl, 1988, Choi et al., 2011, Huang et al., 2022], general nonlinear (c.f., linear [Pearl, 1988, Huang et al., 2022, Xie et al., 2022]) structural functions, and general graph structures (c.f., generalized trees [Pearl, 1988, Choi et al., 2011, Huang et al., 2022]). * Under the same conditions, the author provides identification guarantees for latent variables up to invertible transformations, which, to the best of the author's knowledge, is the first attempt in cases of nonlinear hierarchical models. * The author accompanies their theory with an estimation method that can asymptotically identify the causal structure and latent variables for nonlinear latent hierarchical models and validate it on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets.  The text also includes a detailed literature review of previous causal discovery approaches and discusses the limitations of those approaches compared to the proposed method.
