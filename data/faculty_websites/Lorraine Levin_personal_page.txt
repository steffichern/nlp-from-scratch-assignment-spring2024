I am a computational linguist, specializing in syntax and morphosyntax, especially for low-resource languages.
I am also the co-founder and co-chair of the North American Computational Linguistics Open competition NACLO.
Lab
LLab meets weekly to discuss issues in human language and computation.
See our website for a list of participants, software, corpora, projects, and publications.
Selected Corpora
Corpus of Spoken Mapudungun:
This corpus was produced during a five-year collaborative project between Carnegie Mellon University, Universidad de la Frontera, and the Chilean Ministry of Education (MINEDUC).
It consists of 142 hours of spoken Mapudungun â audio, transcription, and translation into Spanish.
This paper describes the corpus and baseline performance on speech recognition, speech synthesis, and machine translation.
