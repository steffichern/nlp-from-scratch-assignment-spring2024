According to the paper, imperfect machine-generated explanations can help moderators identify subtly toxic content more effectively. The paper states that "our findings showcase the promise of free- text explanations in improving content moderation fairness, and serves as a proof-of-concept of the effectiveness of BIASX, while highlighting the need for AI systems that are more capable of identifying and explaining subtle biases in text." This suggests that while machine-generated explanations may not be perfect, they can still provide some benefit in identifying subtly toxic content. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of these explanations may vary depending on their quality and the specific context in which they are used.

The Framework Tax was published at the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. (Reference: The Framework Tax: Disparities Between Inference Efficiency in Research and Deployment,Abstract: Increased focus on the computational efficiency of NLP systems has motivated the design of efficient model architectures and improvements to underlying hardware accelerators. However, the resulting increases in computational throughput and reductions in floating point operations have not directly translated to improvements in wall-clock inference latency. We demonstrate that these discrepancies can be largely attributed to bottlenecks introduced by deep learning frameworks. We denote this phenomenon as the \textit{framework tax}, and observe that the disparity is growing as hardware speed increases over time. In this work, we examine this phenomenon through a series of case studies analyzing the effects of model design decisions, framework paradigms, and hardware platforms on total model latency. Code is available at <https://github.com/JaredFern/Framework-Tax>.)

The proposed learning objective to improve perceptual quality of speech is to minimize the distance between estimated acoustics for clean and enhanced speech using TAPLoss, which is a Temporal Acoustic Parameter Loss function. This loss function takes into account 25 temporal acoustic parameters, including frequency-related parameters such as pitch, jitter, and bandwidth; energy or amplitude-related parameters such as shimmer, loudness, and HNR ratio; spectral balance parameters such as alpha ratio, Hammarberg index, and spectral slope; and additional temporal parameters such as rate of loudness peaks, mean and standard deviation of length of voiced/unvoiced regions, and continuous voiced regions per second. By optimizing the TAPLoss function, the model can improve the perceptual quality of speech enhancement by retaining the acoustic features that are important for perceived voice quality.

The main benefit of FLARE over existing retrieval augmented LMs is its ability to actively decide when and what to retrieve during generation, leading to more effective and efficient information retrieval. Unlike single-time retrieval augmented LMs, which rely solely on the input data for retrieval, FLARE incorporates a forward-looking approach that considers the future generation context. This allows FLARE to retrieve relevant information at the appropriate times, rather than relying on a fixed retrieval strategy. Additionally, FLARE's use of retrieval queries formulated based on the current generation output can lead to more accurate and informative responses, as it takes into account the context and intent of the previous generation. Overall, FLARE offers a more flexible and adaptive approach to retrieval augmented LMs, leading to improved performance and efficiency.

Fairness Continual Learning proposes two loss functions for mitigating popularity bias in music discovery:  1. Knowledge Distillation Loss: This loss function is used for self-training with soft labels. The goal is to transfer the knowledge of the last model to the current model, and the loss function calculates the margin between the predicted probabilities and the true labels. 2. Fairness Loss: This loss function is used to ensure individual fairness in the recommendation system. It measures the difference between the probability distributions of popular and unpopular items and encourages the model to reduce this gap.  Both loss functions are essential for mitigating popularity bias and promoting diversity in music discovery. By using knowledge distillation, the model can learn from the last model and improve its performance, while the fairness loss ensures that the model treats all items fairly and does not favor popular items over unpopular ones.

Improved accuracy: By combining different machine learning models and techniques, a hybrid model approach can lead to more accurate hedge detection compared to relying on a single model or technique. 2. Enhanced robustness: A hybrid approach can help mitigate the limitations of individual models by leveraging their strengths and compensating for their weaknesses. This can result in a more robust hedge detection system. 3. Better handling of noisy data: Real-world dialogue data can be noisy, containing errors, typos, or ambiguities. A hybrid approach can better handle such data by leveraging the strengths of different models and techniques to improve hedge detection accuracy. 4. Flexibility in model selection: By allowing for multiple models and techniques to compete or cooperate, a hybrid approach offers more flexibility in selecting the most appropriate models for a given task or dataset. This can lead to better performance and more accurate hedge detection. 5. Efficient use of resources: Combining different models and techniques can make more efficient use of computational resources, as some models may be more computationally expensive than others. A hybrid approach can balance the need for accuracy with the need for efficiency in resource usage. 6. Adaptability to changing data: As dialogue data can change over time, a hybrid approach can adapt to these changes by incorporating new models or techniques as needed. This can help maintain accurate hedge detection even as the data evolves. 7. Reduced overfitting: By combining different models and techniques, a hybrid approach can reduce the risk of overfitting to a particular dataset or task. This can lead to more robust and generalizable hedge detection performance. 8. Improved interpretability: A hybrid approach can provide more interpretable results by leveraging multiple models and techniques to explain the reasoning behind hedge detection decisions. This can increase trust in the system and help identify potential areas for improvement. 9. Flexibility in model selection: By allowing for different models and techniques to compete or cooperate, a hybrid approach offers more flexibility in selecting the most appropriate models for a given task or dataset. This can lead to better performance and more accurate hedge detection. 10. Potential for combining strengths of multiple models: A hybrid approach can leverage the strengths of multiple models and techniques to improve hedge detection accuracy, leading to better overall performance.

The OUTDOOR paper introduces the concept of "OUTDOOR," which refers to the task of navigating in outdoor environments that lack clear spatial delineations and are riddled with inherent semantic ambiguities. According to the paper, robots should exist anywhere humans do, including indoors, outdoors, and even unmapped environments. However, the focus of recent advancements in Object Goal Navigation (OGN) has been on navigating in indoor environments by leveraging spatial and semantic cues that do not generalize outdoors. Therefore, the OUTDOOR task provides a new challenge for LLMs to accurately hallucinate possible futures and compute success metrics in more complex domains.

Based on the given context, the KALE vocabulary semantic concepts perform better than the existing lexical English vocabulary in terms of accuracy and efficiency. This is evident from the experimental results presented in the subsection "Complementing Different Representations" where the KALE terms were tested with various retrievers and showed an effectiveness gain at a small latency cost. The results suggest that the KALE terms are able to capture concepts beyond the existing English vocabulary, providing accuracy boosts at relatively small efficiency costs.
The semester drop deadline for fall 2024 is no later than the end of the following academic semester or sooner if required by the instructor. In addition, the work completed up to that date must be of passing quality, and the grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other students.  According to the context information provided, the default letter grade in the event that a student fails to complete the remaining work after the semester drop deadline will become the grade of record. Therefore, it is important for students to communicate early and often with their academic advisor if they are struggling in a course, as the advisor can help them navigate the process of dropping a course or withdrawing from the university before the designated deadline.  In terms of the specific dates, the context information states that the examination period of the following semester is the time frame when the instructor must record the permanent course grade by the last day of the examination period. Therefore, the semester drop deadline for fall 2024 is likely to be around the end of December or early January, depending on the specific academic calendar of Carnegie Mellon University.
SHAP stands for SHapley Additive exPlanation framework. It is a novel feature selection strategy used in computational measures to understand how specific features affect prediction models. The SHAP framework is used to rank features based on their contribution to the predicted outcome, allowing for explainable and interpretable results. In the context of predicting maternal depression from child behavior, SHAP is used to identify the relative contribution of modalities and features within modalities that vary between children of depressed and non-depressed mothers.

CSurF addresses sparse lexicon-based retrieval by leveraging the contextualized surface forms of terms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the retrieval process. By encoding the semantic information of each term in a dense vector space, CSurF can capture the relationships between terms and retrieve relevant passages more accurately. Additionally, by using a sparse representation of the lexicon, CSurF can reduce the dimensionality of the vector space while preserving the important features for retrieval. This enables CSurF to achieve better performance than traditional lexical exact-match systems while maintaining efficiency.

Dogwhistles are coded messages communicated through words or phrases commonly understood by a particular group of people, but not by others. They are used to convey hidden meanings or agendas that may be controversial or sensitive, allowing the sender to avoid direct confrontation or criticism while still conveying their intended message. The term "dogwhistle" was first coined by Henderson and McCready in 2018 to describe this phenomenon, and it has since been studied extensively in various fields, including linguistics, politics, and social sciences.  In general, dogwhistles can take many forms, such as emojis, symbols, or even seemingly innocuous words or phrases. They often rely on shared cultural knowledge or biases to convey their hidden meanings, and they may be used deliberately or unconsciously by individuals or groups to manipulate public opinion or avoid accountability.  Understanding dogwhistles is crucial in today's society, as they can contribute to the polarization and confusion of complex social issues. By recognizing and analyzing dogwhistles, we can better comprehend how information is manipulated and how certain groups or individuals may try to exert influence over public discourse. This knowledge can help us navigate the complex landscape of contemporary politics and culture more effectively.

The proposed forward-backward algorithm in the paper "Deriving Vocal Fold Oscillation Information from Recorded Voice Signals Using Models of Phonation" is the iterative scheme outlined in Equations 1-4 and described as follows:  1. Initialize the estimate of the vocal fold oscillation (VFO) at time $t$ as zero, i.e., $\hat{v}(t) = 0$. 2. For each time frame $t$, compute the predicted VFO signal $\bar{v}(t)$ using the forward model $f(\cdot)$:  $\bar{v}(t) = f(x_t)$ (1)  where $x_t$ is the input signal at time $t$.  3. Compute the difference between the predicted VFO signal and the ground truth VFO signal $\hat{v}(t)$:  $\Delta \hat{v}(t) = \hat{v}(t) - \bar{v}(t)$ (2)  4. Update the estimate of the VFO signal $\hat{v}(t)$ using the backward model $g(\cdot)$:  $\hat{v}(t) = g(\Delta \hat{v}(t))$ (3)  5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each time frame $t$ in the input signal $x$.  By iteratively applying the forward and backward models, the proposed algorithm aims to estimate the VFO signal from the recorded voice signals.

According to the provided text, the success rate of the baseline in the real-world component of the HomeRobot OVMM benchmark is 7,892 out of 150 environments and unique objects. This can be directly referenced in the context as follows: "We use HomeRobot to compare two families of approaches... We observe that while the RL methods moved to the object more efficiently if an object was visible, the heuristic planner was better at long-horizon exploration. We also see a substantial drop in performance when switching from ground-truth segmentation to DETIC segmentation. This highlights the importance of the HomeRobot OVMM challenge, as only through viewing the problem holistically - integrating perception, planning, and action - can we build general-purpose home assistants."

According to the authors of the FLARE paper, one limitation of existing retrieval augmented LMs is that they may not always generate relevant or informative responses, especially when the user input does not provide clear guidance on what information to retrieve (Ho et al., 2020). This can result in the LM relying too heavily on pre-existing knowledge and failing to adapt to new or unexpected situations. To address this limitation, FLARE proposes a forward-looking active retrieval augmented generation framework that actively decides when and what to retrieve based on the user input and generates the answer using retrieval-encouraging instructions or directly using the LM's generation as search queries (Trivedi et al., 2022).

The mapping network in the proposed model plays a crucial role in grounding the frozen text-only large language models (LLMs) to off-the-shelf text-to-image generation models. The mapping network translates the hidden representations of text into the embedding space of the visual models, enabling the LLM to leverage its strong text representations for visual output generation. This allows the proposed model to generate novel images and retrieve images from a prespecified dataset, in addition to conditioning on arbitrarily interleaved image and text inputs to generate coherent image (and text) outputs.

According to the given context, the aerodynamic characteristics of a buggy are determined by several factors, including:  1. Body shape and design: The shape and design of a buggy's body can affect its aerodynamics, with a streamlined or teardrop-shaped body generally being more aerodynamic than a boxy or angular one. 2. Wheels and tires: The size, shape, and placement of the wheels and tires on a buggy can also impact its aerodynamics. Larger, wider tires can create more drag, while smaller, narrower ones may be more efficient. 3. Fairings: The use of fairings, which are housing around the wheels to reduce drag, make the vehicle quieter and look cool, can also affect a buggy's aerodynamics. 4. Pushbar: The pushbar, which is used to move the buggy up hills, can also impact its aerodynamics, as it can create some drag. 5. Driving and braking mechanisms: The type of driving and braking mechanisms used on a buggy can also affect its aerodynamics, as different types of mechanisms may create more or less drag.  Overall, the combination of these factors can determine a buggy's aerodynamic characteristics and how it performs on the race course.

The Paaploss paper proposes a learning objective that formalizes differences in perceptual quality by using domain knowledge of acoustic-phonetics, and develops a neural network estimator that can accurately predict their time-series values across an utterance. Specifically, the estimator predicts the temporal acoustic parameters, such as spectral tilt, spectral flux, shimmer, etc., which are non-differentiable and difficult to model directly. The proposed method adds this criterion as an auxiliary loss to any model that produces speech, optimizing speech outputs to match the values of clean speech in these features. Experimentally, it improves speech enhancement workflows in both time-domain and time-frequency domain, as measured by standard evaluation metrics. Additionally, the analysis of phoneme-dependent improvement on acoustic parameters provides valuable interpretability, suggesting which features are currently the bottleneck for improvement.

The proposed approach in the paper "Rethinking Voice-Face Correlation: A Geometry View" involves using a geometry-based representation of voice and face modalities to analyze their correlation. The authors propose a novel framework that models the voice and face modalities as joint probability distributions over a common space, which allows for the estimation of the correlation between the two modalities. The approach is based on the idea that the correlation between voice and face modalities can be represented as a geometric distance between the corresponding latent spaces, and it provides a more robust and accurate assessment of the correlation compared to traditional methods.  In more detail, the authors propose a deep learning-based framework that integrates voice and face modalities using a shared encoder network. The encoder takes the input data (voice or face) and maps it to a common latent space, where the correlation between the two modalities can be estimated. The authors use a geometry-based distance measure to quantify the correlation between the two modalities in the latent space, which provides a more robust assessment of the correlation compared to traditional methods.  The proposed approach has several advantages over traditional methods. Firstly, it does not rely on hand-crafted features or domain-specific priors, but rather learns a general representation of voice and face modalities from raw data. Secondly, it provides a more robust assessment of the correlation between the two modalities by quantifying the distance between their corresponding latent spaces. Finally, the approach can be applied to a wide range of applications, including voice cloning, face recognition, and human-computer interaction.  In summary, the proposed approach in the paper "Rethinking Voice-Face Correlation: A Geometry View" involves using a geometry-based representation of voice and face modalities to analyze their correlation. It provides a more robust and accurate assessment of the correlation compared to traditional methods and has several advantages over traditional approaches.

According to the paper "Imprecise Label Learning: A Unified Framework for Learning with Various Imprecise Label Configurations" by Y. Cao et al., ILL (Imprecise Label Learning) leverage several sources of information to model imprecise label information, including:  1. Data-based features: These are statistical properties of the data that can be used to capture the uncertainty in the labels, such as the range of values for a particular label or the distribution of labels across different classes. 2. Label-based features: These are direct representations of the label information, such as the number of occurrences of a particular label or the label's confidence score. 3. Knowledge-based features: These are external knowledge sources that can be used to inform the model about the imprecise nature of the labels, such as expert annotations or domain-specific heuristics. 4. Hybrid features: These are combinations of data-based, label-based, and knowledge- based features that can capture complex relationships between the different sources of information. By leveraging these different sources of information, ILL can model the imprecise nature of labels and improve the accuracy of learning tasks in situations where traditional precision-based approaches may struggle.

Reciprocal rank is used to measure the relevance of a query's associated items in a collection of documents. Specifically, it is used to evaluate the ranking of relevant items in terms of their predicted relevance for a given query. The reciprocal rank of a query is defined as the number of positions in the ranking where the first relevant item appears, divided by the total number of positions in the ranking. In other words, it measures how close the first relevant item appears to the top of the ranking.

In the Unlimiformer approach, the cross-attention computation is offloaded to a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index. Specifically, each cross-attention head in the decoder layer queries the kNN index for the top-kkeys, rather than attending to every key in the input sequence. This allows the model to process practically unlimited input sequences without any input truncation at test time.
Based on the provided context, chalk is not permitted in the Fitness Centre at the Jared L. Cohon University Center. According to the information provided in the file path, "The University Center’s recreational facilities include an eight-lane pool, racquetball and squash courts, aerobics room, fitness center and gym for basketball and volleyball. With renovations to Skibo Gym and the new Highmark Center for Health, Wellness, and Athletics scheduled for completion in 2024, the strength and conditioning facility has been temporarily placed on the lawn next to the outdoor basketball court close to the Donner locker rooms, Gesling Stadium, and Weigand Gymnasium. All users must present a valid CMU ID to use these facilities." There is no mention of chalk being allowed in any of the facilities. Therefore, the answer to the query is "No."
The novel architecture introduced in the paper "Efficient Sequence Transduction by Jointly Predicting Tokens and Durations" is called a Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT). It extends conventional RNN-Transducer architectures by jointly predicting both a token and its duration, i.e. the number of input frames covered by the emitted token. This is achieved by using a joint network with two outputs which are independently normalized to generate distributions over tokens and durations.
Training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component has been shown to improve speaker performance in various aspects, including accuracy and fluency. The inclusion of a sufﬁciently inﬂuential ToM reranker during the speaker training process improves speaker per-formance, although the relative gains appear to be much higher when training on easy distractors (Lin et al., 2023). Additionally, we find that speakers trained on more difﬁcult distractors use more similar vocabulary to the ground-truth captions and generate more complex utterances compared to the base speaker. However, we also ﬁnd that training on semantically similar distractors can still achieve up to 5% higher accuracy than the base speaker, indicating some beneﬁts to performance from training on certain harder distractors (Lin et al., 2023).
