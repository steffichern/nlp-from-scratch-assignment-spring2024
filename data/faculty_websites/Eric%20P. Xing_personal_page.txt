Recent
Activities:
On June 11th, 2020, we launched the
CASL (Composible, Automatic, and Scable ML) AutoDist,
AdaptDL,
Alpa),
Automated ML (e.g.,
Dragonfly,
ProBO),
and Composable ML (e.g.,
Texar,
Forte)
implemented across PyTorch and TensorFlow under a unified umbrella for a Production and Industrial AI Platform.
Teaching:
I taught Graduate Introduction to Machine Learning
(10701) again in Fall 2020, with Professor Ziv Bar-Joseph
I have been teaching Probabilistic Graphical Models
(10708), an advanced graduate course on theory, algorithm, and application for multivariate modeling, inference, and deep learning since 2005 at CMU. All the past versions are available here.
Video lectures of Probabilistic Graphical Models (10708):
2014,
2019,
2020.
