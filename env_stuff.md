`psql: error: connection to server on socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed: FATAL:  Peer authentication failed for user "711-rag"`

To solve this issue, you need to edit the pg_hba.conf file to change the authentication method from "peer" to "md5" for the connection you are trying to make (which uses a password to authenticate). Here's how you can do it:

Locate the pg_hba.conf file. This file is usually found in the PostgreSQL data directory, which varies based on how PostgreSQL was installed. Common locations include /etc/postgresql/<version>/main or /var/lib/postgresql/<version>/main, where <version> is your PostgreSQL version. You can often find the exact path by running sudo -u postgres psql -c "SHOW hba_file;" in your terminal.

Open the pg_hba.conf file in a text editor (you'll need superuser privileges to edit it). Look for lines that look like this:

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
local   all             all                                     peer
Change the METHOD from peer to md5 for the line that's relevant to your connection. If you want to apply this change universally, you could change it for the "all" DATABASE and USER fields, but be cautious as this affects all local connections:

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
local   all             all                                     md5
Save the file and exit the editor.

Restart the PostgreSQL service for the changes to take effect. You can typically do this with a command like sudo systemctl restart postgresql, though the exact command might vary depending on your system setup.
