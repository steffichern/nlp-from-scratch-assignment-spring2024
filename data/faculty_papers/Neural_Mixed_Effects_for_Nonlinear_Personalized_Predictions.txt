Abstract: Personalized prediction is a machine learning approach that predicts a person‚Äôs future observations based on their past labeled observations and is typically used for sequential tasks, e.g., to predict daily mood ratings. When making personalized predictions, a model can combine two types of trends: (a) trends shared across people, i.e., person-generic trends, such as being happier on weekends, and (b) unique trends for each person, i.e., person-specific trends, such as a stressful weekly meeting. Mixed effect models are popular statistical models to study both trends by combining person-generic and person-specific parameters. Though linear mixed effect models are gaining popularity in machine learning by integrating them with neural networks, these integrations are currently limited to linear person-specific parameters: ruling out nonlinear person-specific trends. In this paper, we propose Neural Mixed Effect (NME) models to optimize nonlinear person-specific parameters anywhere in a neural network in a scalable manner1. NME combines the efficiency of neural network optimization with nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Empirically, we observe that NME improves performance across six unimodal and multimodal datasets, including a smartphone dataset to predict daily mood and a mother-adolescent dataset to predict affective state sequences where half the mothers experience symptoms of depression. Furthermore, we evaluate NME for two model architectures, including for neural conditional random fields (CRF) to predict affective state sequences where the CRF learns nonlinear person-specific temporal transitions between affective states. Analysis of these person-specific transitions on the mother-adolescent dataset shows interpretable trends related to the mother‚Äôs depression symptoms.

ABSTRACT 
Personalized prediction is a machine learning approach that pre-
dicts a person‚Äôs future observations based on their past labeled 
observations and is typically used for sequential tasks, e.g., to pre-
dict daily mood ratings. When making personalized predictions, a 
model can combine two types of trends: (a) trends shared across 
people, i.e., person-generic trends, such as being happier on week-
ends, and (b) unique trends for each person, i.e., person-specifc

1 INTRODUCTION 
Personalized prediction is a machine learning approach that pre-
dicts a person‚Äôs future observations based on their past labeled 
observations. This type of model is typically used for sequential 
tasks that would be difcult without knowledge of the person, such 
as predicting daily mood from only smartphone data or predicting 
afective state sequences where transitions between states might 
be infuenced by depression [39, 44]. As illustrated in Figure 1, a 
personalized model benefts by combining two types of trends (a) 
person-generic trends shared across people, such as being happier 
on weekends, and (b) unique person-specifc trends, such as stress-
ful weekly meetings or weekly socializing with friends. Person-
specifc trends can be challenging for machine learning models, 
even when trained on data from these people, as they might aver-
age out across people: as exemplifed in Figure 1 when the more 
positive mood from a person‚Äôs socializing coincides with the more 
negative mood of another person‚Äôs stressful meeting. 
Mixed efect models2 are popular in statistics to study person-
generic and person-specifc trends by combining person-generic 
and person-specifc parameters [23]. Linear mixed efect (LME) 
models have recently been gaining popularity in machine learn-
ing for personalizing models [19, 25, 26, 31, 35, 48, 49, 52, 54, 59]. 
Integrating LME with neural networks is currently limited to lin-
ear person-specifc trends: person-specifc parameters can only be 
in the last linear layer of a neural network as illustrated in Fig-
ure 2c. This rules out person-specifc parameters in the remaining 
layers, i.e., nonlinear person-specifc parameters. Separately from 
work with neural networks, nonlinear mixed efect approaches 
2In statistics, the person-generic trends are often referred to as fxed efects and the 
person-specifc trends as random efects. The name mixed efects comes from mixing 
both fxed and random efects. were proposed, but their optimization does not scale to large neural 
networks with many layers and parameters [9]. 
In this paper, we propose Neural Mixed Efect (NME) models 
to learn nonlinear person-specifc parameters in a scalable man-
ner. Our NME models combine the efcient optimization of neural 
networks with the person-specifc parameters of nonlinear mixed 
efect models. NME learns nonlinear person-specifc parameters by 
enabling them anywhere in a nonlinear neural network, as shown 
in Figure 2d. We demonstrate integrating our NME approach into 
two model architectures. We evaluate performance primarily on 
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for better comparison with previ-
ous MLP-LME work. To demonstrate NME for more complex models 
that yet have some interpretable parameters, we integrate NME 
with neural Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to classify states 
in a temporal sequence [12]. CRFs explicitly model a sequence‚Äôs 
temporal dynamics and allow us to interpret the person-specifc 
temporal transitions between states. 
We evaluate NME on six unimodal and multimodal datasets, 
including a smartphone dataset to predict daily mood and a mother-
adolescent dataset to predict afective state sequences where half 
the mothers experience symptoms of depression. We analyze the 
interpretable person-specifc transition parameters in the CRF and 
hypothesize that they difer between families where mothers expe-
rience symptoms of depression. 
2 TECHNICAL AND RELATED BACKGROUND 
Mixed efect models were proposed in statistics for data that is not 
independent and identically distributed, e.g., longitudinal data from 
multiple people [23]. In statistics, the goal of mixed efect models 
is often to study research questions about person-generic trends, 
referred to as fxed efects, and person-specifc trends, referred to

Table 1: Comparison of NME with previous approaches. LME models do not scale well with too many observations per person. 
The sampling-based optimization of NLME does not scale well with too many parameters. NN-LME has nonlinear person-generic 
parameters, but it re-use the optimization of LME, which (*) limits NN-LME to linear person-specifc parameters and it does not 
scale as well for large datasets. Our proposed NME combines the efcient optimization of neural networks with the nonlinear 
persons-specifc parameters of mixed efect models. 
as random efects. Mixed efect models include a penalty term to 
regularize the person-specifc parameters (denoted as  ) so that 
they learn only what the person-generic parameters (denoted as
¬Ø  ) cannot learn. The technical challenge when optimizing mixed 
efect models is to separate fxed and random efects since they 
afect each other, e.g., a random bias term can afect the fxed slope 
of linear mixed efect models [50]. 
We briefy highlight the optimization of linear and nonlinear 
mixed efect models, review related work that explored combina-
tions of neural networks and mixed efect models, and then contrast 
mixed models with multitask learning. 
Linear Mixed Efects (LME): For an observation from the 
-th person represented by a feature vector , a linear mixed ef-
fects model infers the prediction as ÀÜ = ( ¬Ø +  ) , see Figure 2a. 
For efcient optimization, it is often assumed that the random ef-
fects  follow a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean 
and covariance . A popular method to optimize LME models is 
an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that minimizes the 
mean squared error [28]. The challenging part of this EM algo-
rithm is that a matrix needs to be inverted for each person , where 
the matrix size is the number of observations for person . This 
makes it challenging to optimize LME models when a person has 
many observations, i.e., LME models do not easily scale to large 
datasets. 
Nonlinear Mixed Efects (NLME): Nonlinear mixed efect 
models are used to model nonlinear person-specifc trends, for ex-
ample, in pharmacometrics [36]. As shown in Figure 2b, random 
efects can be anywhere in a nonlinear model ÀÜ =  (;  ¬Ø +  )
making their optimization more challenging. While multiple opti-
mization approaches exist for nonlinear mixed efects [4, 9, 29, 42], 
most modern nonlinear mixed efect approaches fnd an approxi-
mate solution using random walk Metropolis sampling [9, 18]. One 
downside of this sampling approach is that it converges slowly for 
large models with many parameters [18]. One upside, compared to 
LME, is that this sampling approach scales well with many obser-
vations as it does not require matrix inversions that depend on the 
number of people or observations. 
Neural Networks with Linear Mixed Efects (NN-LME): 
LME models have been combined with neural networks to im-
prove performance for tasks involving longitudinal data from mul-
tiple people, such as for mood and mental health-related tasks [19, 
31, 48, 49, 52, 54, 59]. All of these combinations follow the same mathematical formulation of ÀÜ = ( ¬Ø +  )  (; neural), see Fig-
ure 2c, where neural are the person-generic parameters of the 
neural network. These combinations can be seen as simply plac-
ing an LME model on top of a neural network. Most NN-LME 
approaches use the same EM algorithm as LME models [28]. The 
only diference is that the neural network parameters neural be-
come part of the fxed efects, meaning the neural network needs 
to be trained until convergence within every E-step, which can 
be slow for large neural networks. By re-using the same EM algo-
rithm from LME models, its limitations apply: the random efects 
will minimize the mean squared error and NN-LME will not easily 
scale to large datasets. While two approaches extend beyond the 
means squared error by fnding an approximate solution for binary 
classifcation[ 48, 49], their work does not generalize to multiclass 
classifcation. 
Our proposed Neural Mixed Efects (NME) approach is a signif-
cant generalization of previous work by allowing person-specifc pa-
rameters, i.e., random efects, anywhere in neural networks where 
even the last layer can be nonlinear. Our proposed NME model 
is also scalable to large datasets and large models by efciently 
optimizing the NLME objective with stochastic gradient descent. 
We summarize this comparison in Figure 2 and Table 1 
Multitask Models: Assuming not all model parameters have 
a person-specifc component, mixed models are similar to multi-
task models where each task corresponds to a person [8, 51]. The 
two main diferences are 1) mixed models have a person-generic 
("shared") component even for parameters that have a person-
specifc component and 2) while multitask models can have an 
additional explicit regularization between the task-specifc param-
eters [13, 53], mixed models do not require a hyper-parameter to 
determine the strength of this regularization as  is learned. 
3 PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Our main goal is personalized prediction: predicting a person‚Äôs 
future observations by training on their past observations. The 
problem of personalized prediction using mixed efects can be for-
malized as follows. Given a training dataset with  people and  
observations for the -th person {( , ) |  ‚àà [1, ],  ‚àà [1,  ]}   
and a test dataset with unseen observations from the same people, 
the goal is to learn a function  ( ; ) predicting  where the  
parameters  are expressed as the sum of a person-generic  ¬Ø and a 
person-specifc component  .

4 NEURAL MIXED EFFECT MODELS 
Mixed efect models are gaining popularity in machine learning 
for personalized predictions as they combine person-generic and 
person-specifc parameters. In this section, we present our gen-
eralization named Neural Mixed Efects (NME) model to better 
integrate mixed efect models in neural networks through a more 
scalable optimization and by allowing person-specifc parameters 
anywhere. The advantage of our proposed NME approach is that it 
enables any neural network architecture to have person-specifc 
parameters  as long as its original parameters (which we will 
refer to as person-generic parameters ¬Ø ) can be optimized with 
gradient descent. The only diference is that the person-specifc 
components  also need to be stored and optimized. When making 
predictions for person , the neural network parameters become the 
sum of these two components   ¬Ø + . Similar to multitask learning, 
not all parameters need a person-specifc component. If parameters 
have no person-specifc components, the parameters are equal to 
the person-generic components ¬Ø . 
We frst focus on the optimization process in subsection 4.1, 
then show that NME is a nonlinear mixed efects model in subsec-
tion 4.2, and fnally, we describe in subsection 4.3 how to predict 
sequences using a neural Conditional Random Field (CRF) and how 
we combine it with NME.

The goal is to learn person-specifc parameters  representing 
person-specifc trends, i.e., that cannot be learned by the person-
generic parameters  ¬Ø. In addition to minimizing a downstream for a person and helps prevent overftting for a person with only a loss function , mixed efect models separate person-generic and few observations. person-specifc trends by regularizing the person-specifc parame-Optimization of Equation 1 is performed with stochastic gradient ters. This regularizing encourages the person-specifc parameters descent in batches, where the regularization term on the right is  to only focus on what cannot be learned by the unregularized scaled by how many observations a person has in the current batch person-generic parameters  ¬Ø. Following previous NN-LME work, . The right part of Equation 1 becomes we regularized the person-specifc parameters by assuming that 
they follow a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean √ç 
and covariance matrix  ‚àà Rdim( )√ódim( ) , where dim( ) is the

To make the regularization invariant to the scale of diferent down-
stream loss functions, mixed efect models have, next to , a second 
weighting factor 2 that represents the average downstream loss. 
The resulting loss function of NME is 1( = ) ‚àà 
 ‚àí1  (2) 
where the indicator function 1( = ) is 1 when the observation 
 is from the -th person, i.e.,  = . 
After each epoch of minimizing Equation 1, we update 2 to the 
new average downstream loss  of the training set and  to the 
sample covariance matrix of the person-specifc parameters  . 
Fortunately, it is common in mixed efect modeling to assume 
that the person-specifc parameters are independent of each other [9, Ô£ÆÔ£ØÔ£ØÔ£ØÔ£ØÔ£∞  (

The left term of Equation 1 optimizes  ¬Ø +  for best downstream 
performance while the right term regularizes the person-specifc 
parameters  . As we have separate persons-specifc parameters  
for each person  but apply the same regularization, we are likely 
to learn larger person-specifc parameters when a person has many 
observations: as the left term, the sum over the number of observa-
tions for a person is more likely to outweigh the regularization term 
on the right when a person has many observations. Intuitively, this 
improves performance the most when we have many observations allows us to efciently optimize Equation 1 even for large models 
with many person-specifc parameters. NMEs with this assumption 
are as fast as multitask models when having the same person/task-
specifc parameters. As seen from Equation 1, the NME objective 
scales linearly with the number of people and their observations 
enabling NME to scale to even large datasets. 
To summarize, 1) NME allows person-specifc parameters any-
where in a neural network, 2) NME uses stochastic gradient descent 
to optimize even large models with many person-specifc parame-
ters efciently, and 3) NME scales linearly with the dataset size.

4.2 NME as a Nonlinear Mixed Efects Model 
NME learns a nonlinear mixed efects model because its optimiza-
tion procedure follows that of the nonlinear mixed efects solver 
saemix [9]. saemix is designed to optimize nonlinear mixed ef-
fect models in statistics using random walk Metropolis sampling. 
However, sampling many parameters for neural networks is typ-
ically computationally challenging, converges slowly, and might 
lead to sub-optimal solutions [ 10, 18, 37]. NME replaces sampling 
with gradient descent to scale to large neural networks with many 
person-specifc parameters. 
saemix is an approximation EM algorithm [11], which means the 
expectation step (E-step) is not required to have converged before 
continuing with the maximization step (M-step). When assuming 
that the person-specifc parameters  follow a multivariate nor-
mal distribution with zero mean and covariance matrix , saemix 
incrementally minimizes Equation 1 during the E-step. During the 
M-step, saemix updates 2 and . Under general assumptions3, 
saemix will converge to a mixed efects model. NME reduces Equa-
tion 1 during each epoch, corresponding to the E-step. Updating 2 
and  between epochs corresponds to the M-steps. As NME follows 
the optimization procedure of saemix, NME will also converge to a 
nonlinear mixed efects model. 
4.3 NME Conditional Random Fields 
When predicting states that have a temporal order, such as the 
sequence of afective states on the mother-adolescent dataset, it can 
be benefcial to account for temporal dynamics, e.g., how likely it 
is to transition from one state to the next. Accounting for temporal 
dynamics may not only improve performance, but it may also be 
possible to interpret which transition the model infers as more or 
less likely. If we can further learn person-specifc transitions, we 
can interpret whether they difer, for example, between families 
where mothers experience symptoms of depression. 
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are graphical models that can 
learn state transitions in an interpretable manner [22]. When the 
transitions are assumed to be time-invariant, i.e., they are constant 
across time, we can represent all possible transitions from one to the 
next state through one matrix  ‚àà R|states|√ó|states| where |states| is 
the number of states. CRFs learn such a transition matrix  . While 
CRFs have been combined with neural networks [12], they have 
not been explored with person-specifc parameters, as done in the

transition matrices  =  +  , which allows us to analyze them. ¬Ø 
Besides a transition matrix  , a CRF needs to know how likely 
each state is at time , which we infer using an MLP. Figure 3 pro-
vides an illustration of NME-CRF. The CRF model can be optimized 
using gradient descent by minimizing the following loss function

exp √ç  ( ;  ¬Ø +  )) + ( ¬Ø +  ) ‚àí1,   ‚àí (3) ([1  , . . . ,  ])  
where  is a normalization function. We use the forward-backward 
algorithm to efciently calculate Equation 3 [5]. To combine the 
CRF with NME, Equation 3 becomes the downstream loss  in Equa-
tion 1. At inference time, we use the viterbi algorithm to efciently 
determine the most likely state sequence [5]. 
5 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
We evaluate our NME approach on six unimodal and multimodal 
datasets, including both regression and multiclass classifcation 
tasks. For better comparison with previous approaches, we primar-
ily integrate NME with MLPs. The mother-adolescent dataset has 
temporal state sequences allowing us to evaluate the NME-CRF. 
We perform a more detailed analysis of the learned parameters of 
the NME-CRF since it learns interpretable state transitions. 
5.1 Datasets 
We conduct experiments on six datasets, summarized in Table 2. 
Imdb [57], News [33], Spotify [32]: These are three public 
datasets used by previous NN-LME work [49]. We follow their 
experimental protocol and use the same features and labels. Instead 
of people being the grouping variable on these datasets, we have 
genres on Imdb and Spotify and outlets on the News datasets as a 
grouping variable, i.e., we learn genre-specifc and outlet-specifc 
parameters. Following previous work, we report the root mean 
squared error (RMSE) for these three datasets. For easier comparison 
across the three datasets, we normalize the RMSE by the standard 
deviation of the ground truth labels on the test set (NRMSE). 
IEMOCAP [7]: The IEMOCAP dataset [7] consists of dyadic 
interactions of fve pairs of people, a total of ten people. Each pair 
is asked to improvise a set of emotionally charged interactions 
spontaneously. We separately predict arousal and valence ratings 
for each person on short utterances using features extracted by 
previous work [58], which includes statistics aggregated at the 
utterance-level of OpenFace 2.0 [3], openSMILE‚Äôs eGeMaPs [14],

and RoBERTa [30]. As is common for IEMOCAP, we use the concor-
dance correlation coefcient (CCC) [24] as the evaluation metrics. 
MAPS [1]: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide 
(MAPS) is a longitudinal dataset of smartphone data of adolescents 
with daily mood self-assessments [1]. We predict the daily mood 
self-assessments using their phone activity from the past 24h. In-
spired by previous phone-based mood prediction work [2, 17, 27, 44], 
we extracted the following features: LIWC dimensions [40] and 
sentiment from Vader [ 16] of the typed text, the number of words, 
total time typing, the mean and variance of the typing speed, the 
weekday, the number of visited places based on GPS data as well as 
distance traveled and the average walking speed. The evaluation 
metric is Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefcient  , which is well suited 
for evaluating how much of the mood variation we can predict. 
TPOT [34]: The Transitions in Parenting of Teens (TPOT) dataset 
contains video recordings of dyadic interactions between mothers 
and their adolescents [34]. By design, mothers of half the dyads 
exhibit at least moderate depression symptoms at recruitment time 
and further had a treatment history for depression (referred to as 
the depressed group). The other half of mothers exhibits at most 
low symptoms, do not have a treatment history of depression, and 
had further no mental health treatment a month before recruitment 
(referred to as the non-depressed group). The interactions are typi-
cally 15 minutes long and focus on resolving areas of disagreement, 
such as participation in household chores. These interactions are 
annotated for each person for a sequence of four afective states 
(other, aggressive, dysphoric, and positive ). These afective states are 
closely related to Living in Familial Environments codes [15, 46]. 
The afective state annotations are onset annotations, i.e., a state 
is annotated when enough evidence is available to determine the 
afective state and last until enough evidence is available for the 
next onset. This annotation approach means that two consecutive 
segments will not have the same label, e.g., positive will not follow 
positive. When using the NME-MLP, we predict these segments 
independently of each other. As the NME-CRF allows us to model 
temporal dynamics, we jointly predict each person‚Äôs sequence of 
segments. In both cases, we use the same features from previous 
work [56], which are similar to the features on IEMOCAP but uses 
LIWC [40] instead of RoBERTa. Following previous work, we report 
Krippendorf‚Äôs  between the ground truth and the predicted labels. 5.2 NME Models and Baselines 
Similar to previous work, we evaluate NME primarily in the con-
text of MLPs (referred to as NME-MLP). Additionally, we evaluate 
NME using neural CRFs for the sequence prediction task on TPOT 
(referred to as NME-CRF). Since our NME approach allows person-
specifc parameters anywhere in the model, we explore three ap-
proaches: 1) having person-specifc parameters in only the last layer 
(denoted as last), 2) for the CRF to additionally have person-specifc 
parameters in its transition matrix  (denoted as last+  ), and 3) 
having them everywhere in the model (denoted as all). Figure 3 
depicts the NME-CRF with person-specifc parameters everywhere, 
including the transition matrix  . 
We compare NME-MLP and NME-CRF to three baselines. 
Generic-MLP: Generic-MLP is either an MLP or a CRF (Generic-
¬Ø CRF) with only person-generic parameters, i.e.,  =  . Generic-
MLP corresponds to a conventional MLP that is directly optimized 
with the downstream loss function . 
Specifc-MLP: Specifc-MLP is either an MLP or a CRF (Specifc-
CRF) with only person-specifc parameters, i.e.,  =  . The person-
specifc parameters are optimized with the downstream loss func-
tion , i.e., they do not follow the NME approach. When evaluating 
person-specifc parameters in only the last layer, we use person-
¬Ø generic parameters in all the previous layers of the MLP, i.e.,  =  
(the same as multitask learning with a task-specifc last layer). 
MLP-LME [59]: Almost all previous MLP-LME work [31, 52, 54, 
59] is based on the same EM algorithm [28]. We implement MLP-
LME as described in previous work [59], which makes MLP-LME 
a baseline for regression tasks with person-generic and person-
specifc parameters in the last layer, i.e.,  =  ¬Ø +  . MLP-LME has 
so far not been extended to multiclass classifcation, so we cannot 
evaluate MLP-LME on TPOT. 
5.3 Experimental Details 
For all datasets we have a within-person split of 60% training, 20% 
validation, and 20% testing. For IEMOCAP, MAPS, and TPOT, the 
frst 60% of the observations per person are used for training, the 
following observations for validation, and the last observations for 
testing. This is done to avoid temporally correlated observations 
that would invalidate the validation or test set.

All models are implemented in PyTorch [38] and optimized with 
Adam [20]. Their hyper-parameter are determined using a grid-
search which includes the learning rate, the number of layers in 
the MLP and their width, and L2 weight decay. Model validation is 
based on the validation set performance. All models are trained on 
consumer-level graphic cards, such as, the NVidia RTX 3080 Ti. 
All input features are z-normalized on the training set. For re-
gression tasks, the ground truth is also z-normalized based on the 
training set. The mean squared error is the loss function  for all 
regression tasks. For the MLP on TPOT, we minimize the cross 
entropy loss, while the forward-backward algorithm is used for 
the CRF on TPOT to minimize Equation 3. Features from diferent 
modalities are combined through early fusion. 
When reporting performance metrics, we frst calculate them 
within each person and then report the average. This allows us 
to focus on the within-person performance and avoids Simpson‚Äôs 
paradox [50]. Signifcance tests are conducted with paired person-
clustered bootstrapping [45] using  = 0.05 and 10,000 resamplings 
at the person-level4. To determine the performance metrics reliably, 
we need a large enough test set per person: we remove people from 
all experiments if we have less than ten observations from them. 
6 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
We frst present the NME-MLP experiments across all six datasets 
and then focus on analyzing the NME-CRF multiclass classifcation 
experiments on the TPOT dataset. 
6.1 NME-MLP Experiments 
Last layer with person-specifc parameters: We frst evaluate 
NME-MLP with person-specifc parameters in only the last layer 
for a direct comparison with MLP-LME [ 59]. NME-MLP performs 
numerically equal or better than all three baselines (Generic-MLP, 
Specifc-MLP, and MLP-LME) on the six datasets, see the top half 
of Table 3. While Specifc-MLP incurs a performance drop for the 
two smaller datasets, i.e., IEMOCAP and MAPS, NME-MLP main-
tains or improves performance indicating that it is important to 
have both person-generic and person-specifc parameters. Unlike 
4For each person, calculate the performance metric and take their diference between 
two models. Then bootstrap the diferences by resampling 10,000 times with replace-
ment to derive 95% confdence intervals using percentiles. Table 4: Performance of the CRF on TPOT. Best overall perfor-
mance is underlined while best performance for the last/all 
layers is in bold.

current MLP-LME implementations, NME-MLP can also be applied 
to multiclass classifcation on the TPOT dataset. NME-MLP again 
performs numerically better than its baselines. As indicated by the 
superscripts in Table 3, NME performs in many cases statistically 
signifcantly better compared to its baselines. 
All layers with person-specifc parameters: As illustrated in 
Figure 2d, NME enables person-specifc parameters anywhere in 
a neural network. The bottom half of Table 3 summarizes the per-
formance with person-specifc parameters everywhere. NME-MLP 
numerically outperforms Specifc-MLP and Generic-MLP. Having 
person-specifc parameters everywhere also leads to the best per-
formance across all IEMOCAP experiments suggesting that people 
in IEMOCAP may have nonlinear person-specifc trends. 
Interpretation of baseline levels: NME-MLPs for regression 
 +  ¬Øbias +  infer their prediction as ÀÜ = ( ¬Ø +  )  
bias where 
 is the representation learned by previous layers. It is possible  
that  ¬Øbias +  
bias will correspond to a person‚Äôs baseline level on the 
training set. As can be observed in Figure 4,  
bias is highly correlated 
with the baseline level on all datasets, including IEMOCAP ( = 
0.669 for arousal and  = 0.543 for valence). A potential explanation 
for why the magnitude of  
bias is very small on IEMOCAP could 
be that the improvised dyads might be easier to predict, making it 
unnecessary for the model to encode the baseline levels. 
6.2 NME-CRF Experiments 
NME-CRF improves performance: We study the temporal struc-
ture of afective states on TPOT with the NME-CRF. While pre-
vious MLP-LME [59] work does not generalize to temporal struc-
tures, such as modeled by a CRF, our NME easily extends CRFs. 
Table 4 shows that NME-CRF numerically improves over its base-
lines, demonstrating that even more complex models beneft from 
having person-specifc parameters and that the transition patterns 
on TPOT depend on the person. 
Interpretation of temporal transitions: The NME-CRF model 
allows analyzing the learned person-specifc transition parameters. 
We focus on whether they difer between families (both adolescents 
and mothers) in the depressed and non-depressed group. We focus 
on this balanced group for two reasons 1) transition patterns have 
previously been linked to depression [46], and 2) already the ground 
truth base rate of the four afective states is diferent between them 
as indicated by the Chi-squared test 2 (3, 8946) = 61.0,  < 0.001.

Positive [-8.3 -1.6] [0.3 2.2 ] [0.1 5.5 ] [0.0, 1.8] 
As visualized in Figure 5, we group the person-specifc transi-
tion matrices and then compare their diferences. The multivari-
ate Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) [41]5 indicates 
that the two groups have signifcantly diferent transition matrices 
HSIC = 0.71,  = 0.006. 
The 95% confdence intervals of the diferences in the transition 
probabilities between families in the depressed and non-depressed 
group shown in Table 5 indicate six signifcant diferences between 
them. While families in the non-depressed group are more likely 
to transition from positive to the majority class other, families in 
the depressed group are more likely to transition to aggressive and 
dysphoric. Similar trends are observed for transitions from other: 
families in the non-depressed group are more likely to transition 
to positive while families in the depressed group are more likely 
to transition into aggressive. These observations seem plausible as 
more aggressive and less positive behaviors have been associated 
with depression [21, 46, 47]. As illustrated with the above analyses, 
it is possible to interpret the learned person-specifc parameters 
learned by NME. 
5We use the implementation from the R package dHSIC. Regularization term needed for many person-specifc pa-
rameters and small datasets: To test in which situations the reg-
ularization term of NME, i.e., the right part of Equation 1, is needed 
for good performance, we train an unregularized NME (uNME) 
that does not have the regularization term. We evaluate (u)NME 
with 1) person-specifc parameters in diferent model parts of the 
CRF, and 2) with less and less training data per person. Figure 6 
indicates that the regularization term is needed for many person-
specifc parameters and on smaller datasets. Even with little data, 
NME-CRF always performs better than the Generic-CRF despite 
having more parameters. As described in subsection 4.1, mixed 
efect models tend to learn smaller person-specifc parameters for a 
person with little data which helps avoid overftting. In the extreme 
case of having very little data per person, the NME-CRF should 
converge to the Generic-CRF as the person-specifc parameters will 
barely be used [43]. This trend can be observed in Figure 6 as the 
performance gap between NME-CRF and Generic-CRF narrows 
with fewer observations per person. 
7 CONCLUSION 
We demonstrated that personalized models beneft by combining 
two types of trends: (a) person-generic trends shared across people 
and (b) unique person-specifc trends. Linear mixed efect models 
are gaining popularity in machine learning for personalization as 
they combine these two trends. We proposed Neural Mixed Efect 
(NME) models to generalize previous work integrating linear mixed 
efect models in neural networks. NME allows person-specifc pa-
rameters anywhere in a neural network to learn nonlinear person-
specifc trends. NME‚Äôs optimization is further scalable to large 
datasets and large neural networks. NME achieved this by com-
bining the efcient neural network optimization with the person-
specifc parameters of nonlinear mixed efect models. We evaluated 
NME on six unimodal and multimodal datasets covering regression 
and classifcation tasks and observed numerical improvements on 
all six datasets. Further, we showed that NME can be combined 
with neural conditional random felds to learn interpretable person-
specifc temporal transitions. Finally, we demonstrated that person-
specifc parameters can be interpreted, for example, we observed 
that the person-specifc transition matrices of the NME-CRF are 
diferent for families in the depressed group. 
When multiple group variables are known to be present, e.g., 
people and diferent cultural backgrounds, it would be interesting 
to extend NME to a multilevel model [6]. An additional future 
direction, is evaluating which modalities, modal parts, or tasks 
beneft the most from NME.
