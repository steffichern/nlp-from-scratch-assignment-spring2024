Abstract: People share stories online for a myriad of purposes, whether as a means of self-disclosure, processing difficult personal experiences, providing needed information or entertainment, or persuading others to share their beliefs. Better understanding of online storytelling can illuminate the dynamics of social movements, sensemaking practices, persuasion strategies, and more. However, unlike other media such as books and visual content where the narrative nature of the content is often overtly signaled at the document level, studying storytelling in online communities is challenging due to the mixture of storytelling and non-storytelling behavior, which can be interspersed within documents and across diverse topics and settings. We introduce a codebook and create the Storytelling in Online Communities Corpus, an expert-annotated dataset of 502 English-language posts and comments with labeled story and event spans. Using our corpus, we train and evaluate an online story detection model, which we use to investigate the role storytelling of in different social contexts. We identify distinctive features of online storytelling, the prevalence of storytelling among different communities, and the conversational patterns of storytelling.
