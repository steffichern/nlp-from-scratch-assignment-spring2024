The document is a research article titled "Association between albumin-to-globulin ratio and the risk of overall survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with anlotinib treatment: a retrospective cohort study". The authors aimed to investigate the relationship between AGR (albumin- to-globulin ratio) and OS (overall survival) in patients with advanced NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) who received anlotinib treatment. They conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 196 patients, and found that after adjusting for potential confounders, there was a non-linear relationship between AGR and OS, with an inflection point of 1.24. The hazard ratio on the left side of the inflection point was 13.05 (0.52 to 327.64), and on the right side it was 0.20 (0.07 to 0.57). Therefore, a high AGR level may be an independent protective factor for OS in advanced NSCLC patients who received anlotinib therapy.

The paper "When to generate hedges in peer-tutoring interactions" investigates the application of machine learning techniques to predict where hedging occurs in peer-tutoring interactions. The study uses a naturalistic face-to-face dataset annotated for natural language turns, conversational strategies, tutoring strategies, and nonverbal behaviors. The results show that embedding layers significantly improve the model's performance and provide insights into the importance of interpersonal rapport and nonverbal behaviors in predicting hedges using Shapley values for feature explanation. The discovery is further validated through a follow-up ablation study, revealing that the eye gaze of both the tutor and tutee has a significant impact on hedge prediction.

This paper develops a theory for identifying latent variables and causal structures in nonlinear latent hierarchical models, which is applicable to continuous multi-dimensional variables and general graph structures. The main contributions include a novel identifiability theory (Theorem 3.2), structure identification guarantees, and an estimation method that can asymptotically identify the causal structure and latent variables. The paper also discusses experimental setup for synthetic data generation and results on various datasets.
