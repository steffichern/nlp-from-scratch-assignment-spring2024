Daniel Fried
I'm an assistant professor at the Language Technologies Institute in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, working on natural language processing.
My work focuses on enabling people to use language to interact with computers to carry out useful tasks in the world.
One recurring theme in my work is pragmatics: viewing language as an action that people take in context to affect their communicative partners (see our survey and position paper).
I'm excited about domains where computers can complement human abilities. Recently, I've been focusing on code generation, aiming to make programming more communicative.
Before CMU, I was a postdoc at FAIR Seattle and the University of Washington. I completed a PhD at UC Berkeley in the NLP Group and the , an M.Phil. at the Cambridge Computer Laboratory and a B.S. at the University of Arizona.
Sponsorship: Our work has been supported by gifts from the Okawa Foundation, Google, Cisco Systems, and Autodesk.

Unfortunately, I do not have internship openings for students outside CMU at this time.

Grounded interaction
How can we help people use language to interact with computers to carry out tasks in the world? I'm especially interested in multi-turn, task-oriented settings.

Code generation
We're aiming to make programming more communicative, by creating models, methods, and datasets for producing code from language.

Applied pragmatics
Much of our work takes a multi-agent system perspective on communication, showing that we can improve NLP agents by modeling the intents and interpretations that people have when they use language.
