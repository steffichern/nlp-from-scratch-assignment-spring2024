Sure, here is a summary of the text provided in the context:  The text describes a study investigating the relationship between albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR) and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with anlotinib. The study found that AGR is an independent protective factor for OS in advanced NSCLC patients who received anlotinib therapy. For every 1 unit increase in AGR, the risk of death was lowered by 80%. The study also discovered a threshold effect on the linear relationship between AGR and OS, with an inflection point of 1.24.

Sure, here is a summary of the text provided in the context:  The text describes the application of machine learning techniques to predict where hedging occurs in peer-tutoring interactions. The study uses a naturalistic face-to-face dataset annotated for natural language turns, conversational strategies, tutoring strategies, and nonverbal behaviors. The results show that embedding layers, capturing the semantic information of the previous turns, significantly improves the model’s performance. Additionally, the study provides insights into the importance of various features, such as interpersonal rapport and nonverbal behaviors, in predicting hedges. The study also discovers that the eye gaze of both the tutor and the tutee has a significant impact on hedge prediction.

Sure, here is a summary of the text "Identification_of_Nonlinear_Latent_Hierarchical_Models":  The text describes a method for identifying latent variables and causal structures in nonlinear latent hierarchical models. The key takeaways are:  * **Identifiability guarantees:** The text develops novel identifiability guarantees for latent hierarchical models, encompassing continuous, discrete, and general graph structures. It also provides identification guarantees for latent variables up to invertible transformations. * **Estimation method:** An estimation method is presented for asymptotically identifying the causal structure and latent variables for nonlinear latent hierarchical models. This method is validated on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. * **Applications:** The text applies the proposed method to recover the causal structure and latent variables from various datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.  **References:**  * [Spirtes et al., 2000] * [Huang et al., 2022] * [Pearl, 1988] * [Choi et al., 2011]
