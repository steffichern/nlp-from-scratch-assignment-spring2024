The article "Association between albumin-to-globulin ratio and the risk of overall survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with anlotinib treatment: a retrospective cohort study" investigates the relationship between the albumin-to-globulin (A/G) ratio and overall survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving anlotinib treatment. The study includes 153 patients and finds that a higher A/G ratio is associated with poorer overall survival. The study also explores the potential mechanisms underlying this association, including inflammation and immune response.  The study found that patients with a higher A/G ratio had a lower overall survival rate compared to those with a lower A/G ratio. The hazard ratio for overall survival was 2.36 (95% CI: 1.41-3.90) in the unadjusted analysis and 1.78 (95% CI: 1.03-3.07) after adjusting for age, gender, performance status, and treatment variables. The study also found that the A/G ratio was significantly higher in patients who progressed faster compared to those who progressed more slowly.  The study suggests that inflammation and immune response may play a role in the association between the A/G ratio and overall survival. The study found that high levels of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC), were associated with poorer overall survival. Additionally, the study found that low levels of immune response markers, such as CD3+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, were also associated with poorer overall survival.  The study has some limitations, including its retrospective nature and small sample size. However, the findings suggest that the A/G ratio may be a useful marker for predicting overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving anlotinib treatment. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.  In conclusion, the study provides evidence that the A/G ratio is associated with overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving anlotinib treatment. The study suggests that inflammation and immune response may play a role in this association, and further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.
The paper "Association between albumin-to-globulin ratio and the risk of overall survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with anlotinib treatment: a retrospective cohort study" was published in 2020.

The paper "When to generate hedges in peer-tutoring interactions" (2023) explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict when hedging occurs in peer-tutoring interactions. The study uses a naturalistic face-to-face dataset annotated for natural language turns, conversational strategies, tutoring strategies, and nonverbal behaviors. The authors find that embedding layers, capturing the semantic information of the previous turns, significantly improves the model’s performance and provides insights into the importance of various features, such as interpersonal rapport and nonverbal behaviors, in predicting hedges by using Shapley values for feature explanation. They discover that the eye gaze of both the tutor and the tutee has a significant impact on hedge prediction.

The paper "Identification of Nonlinear Latent Hierarchical Models" presents a novel approach for identifying latent variables and causal structures in nonlinear, general non-Gaussian latent hierarchical models. The proposed method is based on a new identifiability theory that guarantees the existence of a unique solution for the identified latent variables and causal structure under mild assumptions. The method uses an estimation algorithm to recover the latent variables and causal structure, which are validated using multiple synthetic and real-world datasets.  The main contributions of the paper are:  1. Analogous to independence tests in PC algorithm [Spirtes et al., 2000] and rank-deficiency tests in Huang et al. [2022], a novel identifiability theory is developed as a fundamental criterion for locating and identifying latent variables in general nonlinear causal models. 2. Structure identification guarantees are provided for latent hierarchical models admitting continuous multi-dimensional (c.f., one-dimensional and often discrete [Pearl, 1988, Choi et al., 2011, Huang et al., 2022, Xie et al., 2022]) variables, general nonlinear (c.f., linear [Pearl, 1988, Huang et al., 2022, Xie et al., 2022]) functions, and arbitrary discrete distributions. 3. An estimation algorithm is proposed to recover the identified latent variables and causal structure, which are validated using multiple synthetic and real-world datasets.  The key idea of the proposed method is to use a novel identifiability criterion that combines the concept of "generality" (i.e., the ability to capture arbitrary discrete distributions) with the idea of "independence" (i.e., the ability to disentangle causal relationships among latent variables). This allows for identifying latent variables and causal structures in nonlinear, general non-Gaussian models, which is not possible with traditional methods that assume linearity or discrete data.  The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief review of related work on latent variable discovery and causal inference. Section 3 presents the proposed identifiability criterion and estimation algorithm. Section 4 validates the proposed method using multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Finally, Section 5 concludes with a discussion of future directions and potential applications of the proposed approach.
