I
am a faculty member in Computer
Science Program at Carnegie
Mellon University â Qatar. My CMU departmental affiliation
is with the Language
Technologies Institute.
Here
is a recent CV.
I also take pictures
occasionally. Here
are some of the better ones on Flickr.
Follow
@oflazer
on Twitter. Mostly Computer Science and NLP stuff, and random fun
stuff I encounter. (English/Turkish).
Over
the years, I have found that this
video explains most of what I see around. Enjoy!
Check out
I
gave two talks at BoÄaziÃ§i
University Summer School on Machine Learning in Speech and
Language Processing, and Bioinformatics, in Istanbul, Turkey,
July 2-6, 2018. Here are the videos (in Turkish):

I
gave a tutorial on Natural Language Processing and Language
Modeling at the 3rd
Summer School on Data Science , at SabancÄ± University in
Istanbul, Turkey, Sept 7-8, 2019.
Thanks
to volunteer efforts by BaÅak Buluz Yavuz KÃ¶meÃ§oÄlu, and M.
AyyÃ¼ce KÄ±zrak, the Proceedings
of the First Turkish Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and
Artificial Neural Networks , that I had co-edited in 1992, is
now online. Papers are in Turkish and English. Enjoy!
I
gave a tutorial on NLP at Bilkent
University Summer School on Machine Learning, in Ankara,
Turkey, July 1, 2020. The video (in Turkish) of the tutorial is
here. I
gave the same tutorial at the Sabanci
University Data Science Summer School in Istanbul, Turkey,
September 25, 2020.
On
June 22, 2021, I gave an introductory talk on NLP at SICSS
- Istanbul -- Summer Institute in Computational Social Science,
aimed at students working in that field. The video of the talk is
here.
