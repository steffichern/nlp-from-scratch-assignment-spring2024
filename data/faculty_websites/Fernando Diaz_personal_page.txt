Introduction
My recent projects include, Evaluationpreference-based evaluation: improving the sensitivity of evaluation metrics by measuring pairwise preferences between systems.fairness in ranking: designing evaluation metrics for ranked lists of items capturing different notions of fairness.artificial intelligence and culture: understanding and measuring the impact of artificial intelligence on culture industries such as music, film, and literature.Algorithm Designretrieval-enhanced machine learning: designing algorithms to support machine learning systems.tip of the tongue retrieval: designing algorithms to help people re-find previously consumed content. My previous projects have included text summarization in crisis informatics contexts, inferring user intent from mouse cursor behavior, aggregated search, time-sensitive ranking, and core retrieval algorithms.
