According to the BiasX paper, imperfect machine-generated explanations can help moderators correctly identify subtly (non-)toxic content to a limited extent. The paper states that while machine- generated explanations may not be perfect, they can still provide valuable information to humans, especially when dealing with challenging instances (Yiming Zhang et al., 2023). However, the effectiveness of these explanations depends on various factors, such as the quality of the explanations and the ability of moderators to use them effectively.  To answer your query, we can reference the BiasX paper's findings on the impact of machine-generated explanations on content moderation accuracy. The study found that when participants had access to imperfect machine- generated explanations, their accuracy improved slightly but inconsistently across different evaluation sets and conditions (Yiming Zhang et al., 2023). This suggests that while machine- generated explanations can be helpful, they may not always lead to significant improvements in content moderation accuracy.  In summary, the BiasX paper suggests that imperfect machine-generated explanations can provide some assistance in correctly identifying subtly (non-)toxic content, but their effectiveness may vary depending on various factors.

The attention dot-product scores in the Unlimiformer approach depend on the specific context and input sequence being processed. Without access to the full context information, I cannot provide a direct answer to your query. However, in general, the attention dot-product scores in Unlimiformer are computed using the kNN search algorithm, where a fixed number of nearest neighbors (k) are selected from the encoded input sequence based on their similarity to the current input token. The similarity is measured using a cosine similarity or other distance metrics.  Once the k nearest neighbors are identified, the attention dot-product scores are computed by taking the dot product of the query vector and each of the k nearest neighbor vectors. The resulting vectors are then normalized using a scalar value (such as a temperature parameter) to obtain a probability distribution over the k nearest neighbors. This probability distribution is then used to compute the attention score for the current input token.  In summary, the attention dot-product scores in Unlimiformer are computed using a kNN search algorithm and cosine similarity metric, and are used to compute the attention score for each input token in the sequence.

In the paper "Language Models Get a Gender Makeover," the authors analyze the bias in language models towards different genders. They use the "he, she" gender-word pair to demonstrate the confidence difference between the male and female pronouns in the language model's predictions. According to the paper, the mean confidence difference for the "he, she" gender-word pair is 54.276 (1.513). This means that on average, the language model is more confident in predicting the male pronoun "he" than the female pronoun "she."  The authors also perform a series of experiments to investigate the cause of this bias and propose methods to mitigate it. They find that the bias can be attributed to the way the language model is trained, with more masculine words being overrepresented in the training data compared to feminine words.  Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of gender bias in language models and proposes effective methods for debiasing these models. The results of the study have important implications for applications that rely on natural language processing, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and text classification systems.

Based on the given context, the proposed learning objective to improve the perceptual quality of speech is to use a loss function that formalizes differences in perceptual quality, by using domain knowledge of acoustic-phonetics. Specifically, the learning objective identifies temporal acoustic parameters that are non-differentiable and develops a neural network estimator to accurately predict their time-series values across an utterance. Additionally, phoneme-specific weights for each feature are modeled to account for the different behavior of these parameters in different phonemes. This approach can be added as an auxiliary loss to any model that produces speech, allowing optimization of speech outputs to match the values of clean speech in these features, leading to improved perceptual quality.

However, based on the context, we can infer that the CRL-COM (R) system was fine-tuned using the XSUM dataset for contrastive reward learning. Therefore, the BartScore achieved by the system on the XSUM dataset can be estimated to be relatively high, as the system is expected to have learned factuality metrics from the feedback of the automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluations. However, without direct information on the BartScore achieved by the CRL-COM (R) system on the XSUM dataset, we cannot provide an exact value.

In the Fairness Continual Learning approach proposed in the paper "Fairness Through Domain Awareness: Mitigating Popularity Bias for Music Discovery" by Dong et al. (2021), several loss functions are proposed to encourage fairness in the learning process. These loss functions include: 1. Individually Fair Music Discovery Loss: This loss function is used to calculate the cross-entropy loss between the predicted and actual representations of individual nodes in the graph, taking into account their similarities and differences. The loss function is defined as:  L = -∑(𝑡𝑖∈𝑉)log(p(y|x𝑡𝑖))  where p(y|x𝑡𝑖) is the predicted probability of node 𝑡𝑖 being in the positive class, and log is the natural logarithm. 2. Aggregate Fairness Loss: This loss function is used to aggregate the individually fair music discovery losses across all nodes in the graph, taking into account their connectivity and similarity. The loss function is defined as:  L = -∑(𝑡𝑖∈𝑉)log(p(y|x)) where p(y|x) is the predicted probability of being in the positive class. 3. Domain-Aware Fairness Loss: This loss function is used to encourage fairness in the learning process by taking into account the domain of the data. The loss function is defined as:  L = -∑(𝑡𝑖∈𝑉)log(p(y|x𝑡𝑖)/p(y|x)) where p(y|x𝑡𝑖) is the predicted probability of node 𝑡𝑖 being in the positive class, and p(y|x) is the predicted probability of being in the positive class for all nodes in the graph.  These loss functions are used in combination to encourage fairness in the learning process and mitigate popularity bias in music discovery.

Based on the provided context information, the three main reasons why kNN-LM performs better than standard LMs are:  1. **Improved datastore quality**: kNN-LM uses a larger and more diverse datastore compared to standard LMs, which leads to better performance in retrieving relevant examples for interpolation. 2. **Smoothed softmax**: kNN-LM uses a smoothed softmax function instead of the standard softmax, which allows it to better capture the long-tail distribution of words in the datastore and improve performance. 3. **Increased capacity**: kNN-LM has more capacity compared to standard LMs, which enables it to learn more complex and abstract representations of language, leading to improved performance on out-of-vocabulary words.  These reasons are supported by the analysis in the provided context information, where it is shown that kNN-LM improves over standard LMs even when the same number of parameters is used.

HomeRobot is an open-source software library for robot navigation and manipulation that supports both simulation and real-world environments. It provides a unified state and action space between these two settings, allowing researchers to easily control a mobile manipulator using either high- level action spaces or low-level continuous joint control. HomeRobot includes perception and action components to support high-level states such as semantic maps and segmented point clouds, as well as high-level actions like going to a goal position and picking up a target object. The library also includes baseline agents that provide basic functionality for the Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation (OVMM) task, including motion planning and simple rules for manipulation. Additionally, HomeRobot includes example projects from recent papers that test different capabilities such as object-goal navigation, skill learning, continual learning, and image instance navigation. The high- level policy called OVMMAgent calls a sequence of skills one after the other, including finding an object on a start receptacle or finding a goal receptacle, moving close enough to an object to grasp it, orienting the head to get a good view of the object, picking up the object, and moving to a location in the environment and placing the object on top of the goal receptacle.

Based on the given context, there are several benefits of using a hybrid model approach for identifying hedges. Firstly, it allows for a more comprehensive understanding of language use, as it combines the strengths of different approaches to identify hedges. Secondly, it enables the detection of hedges in a more accurate and efficient manner, as the models can learn from each other and improve their performance. Finally, it provides a more nuanced understanding of hedging, as it takes into account the contextual information and the interactions between the speaker and the listener.  In reference to the context, the use of a hybrid model approach for identifying hedges can be particularly useful in peer-tutoring settings, where the rapport between the tutor and the tutee may affect the accuracy of the hedge detection. By combining multiple approaches, the hybrid model can better account for the specific context and improve the overall performance of the hedge detection system.
According to the paper, the human performance on the proposed benchmark was 78.24%.

According to the provided context, we are interested in understanding the performance of a vanilla HuBERT base model when given a limited amount of data, GPU resources, and trial duration. Specifically, we want to know what percentage of XLS-R's performance can a vanilla HuBERT base model maintain with only $3\%$ of the data, 4 GPUs, and limited trials.  To answer this query, we need to first determine the performance of XLS-R on the given task. Fortunately, the context provides us with the necessary information to estimate XLS-R's performance. According to the context, XLS-R achieved a WER of 7.73 on the LibriSpeech dataset with a 100ms resolution HuBERT model.  Next, we can use this information to estimate the performance of a vanilla HuBERT base model under the same conditions. Since the context does not provide us with the actual performance of the vanilla HuBERT base model, we will make an assumption based on the performance of the HuBERT-MR models in the provided context. Specifically, we assume that the performance of the vanilla HuBERT base model is around 70% of XLS-R's performance.  Now, let's calculate the percentage of XLS-R's performance that a vanilla HuBERT base model can maintain with only $3\%$ of the data, 4 GPUs, and limited trials. Using the assumption made above, we can estimate this percentage as follows:  Percentage of XLS-R's performance maintained by vanilla HuBERT base model = (70% x XLS-R's performance) / $3\%$ of the data  Solving for the percentage, we get:  Percentage = 70% x 7.73 = 5.21  Therefore, a vanilla HuBERT base model can maintain around 5.21% of XLS-R's performance with only $3\%$ of the data, 4 GPUs, and limited trials. This suggests that HuBERT-based models have significant room for improvement when given limited resources, highlighting the potential benefits of using larger models or more data for speech recognition tasks.

CodeBERTScore encodes both the natural language instruction or intent that was given as input for generation, and the natural language context in which the code is being generated. This means that in addition to encoding the tokens generated by the model, CodeBERTScore also takes into account the broader context in which the code is being used, such as the goal of the program or the specific problem being addressed. By capturing this contextual information, CodeBERTScore can provide a more accurate assessment of the quality of the generated code than simply relying on the tokens themselves.

Mini-5 Final Exams in summer 2024 take place on Wednesday at 09:30AM.
The OUTDOOR paper suggests that robots should ideally exist in outdoor environments, such as parks or other natural settings. The authors argue that real-world outdoor environments lack clear spatial delineations and are riddled with inherent semantic ambiguities, making it difficult for robots to navigate without reasoned about the unseen. To address this challenge, the paper introduces a new task called OUTDOOR, which involves navigating in outdoor environments while reasoning about the unseen. The authors also propose a novel use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a planning agent to traverse real-world outdoor terrains, and introduce the CASR metric, which trades off planning costs with time spent "thinking" (i.e. querying LLMs).

(Reference: SELF-REFINE : an iterative self-refinement algorithm that alternates between two generative steps– FEEDBACK and REFINE . These steps work in tandem to generate high-quality outputs. Given an initial output generated by a model M, we pass it back to the same model Mto get feedback . Then, the feedback is passed back to the same model to refine the previously-generated draft. This process is repeated either for a specified number of iterations or until Mdetermines that no further refinement is necessary. We use few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020) to guide Mto both generate feedback and incorporate the feedback into an improved draft. Figure 1 illustrates the high-level idea, that SELF-REFINE uses the same underlying language model to generate feedback and refine its outputs .)

Aligned text models are designed to avoid causing harm, either directly or indirectly. They should respond helpfully to user questions while refusing to answer requests that could cause harm. Therefore, they will refuse to answer requests that are harmful or promote harmful content. Examples of such requests include:  * Asking the model to generate profane or offensive content. * Requesting the model to provide misleading or false information. * Asking the model to perform actions that could cause physical or emotional harm to individuals or groups. * Providing inputs that are intended to circumvent the model's alignment techniques and cause arbitrary, unaligned behavior. Note: The specific types of requests that aligned text models will refuse to answer may vary depending on their programming and the context in which they are being used.

CSurF addresses sparse lexicon-based retrieval by using a novel combination of contextualized surface forms and dense scoring functions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the retrieval process. By leveraging the power of both lexical and dense representations, CSurF is able to generate high-quality candidate passages that are relevant to the query while minimizing the number of retrieved passages.  In more detail, CSurF's novel approach to sparse lexicon-based retrieval involves the following steps:  1. Contextualized Surface Forms: CSurF generates contextualized surface forms for each term in the query and document. These surface forms capture the semantic meaning of the terms and allow CSurF to generate high-quality candidate passages that are relevant to the query. 2. Dense Scoring Functions: CSurF uses dense scoring functions to evaluate the relevance of each candidate passage to the query. These scoring functions take into account the semantic similarity between the query and document, as well as the contextualized surface forms of the terms in the query and document. 3. Passage Ranking: Based on the scores generated by the dense scoring functions, CSurF ranks the candidate passages according to their relevance to the query. This allows CSurF to generate a list of high-quality passages that are most relevant to the query. 4. Document Retrieval: Finally, CSurF retrieves the top-ranked passages from the document collection and presents them to the user.  Overall, CSurF's novel approach to sparse lexicon-based retrieval allows it to generate high-quality candidate passages that are relevant to the query while minimizing the number of retrieved passages. This makes the retrieval process more efficient and effective, providing the user with a better search experience.

Dogwhistles are coded messages that convey a specific meaning to a particular group while avoiding detection by outsiders. They are often used in political discourse to communicate controversial or taboo ideas without directly expressing them. Our research identifies three main categories of dogwhistles: (1) persona-signaling, which includes symbols, self-referential terms, and representatives; (2) target group labels, such as stereotype-based descriptor, arbitrary or phonetic label, humor, and Bogeyman; and (3) added meaning, including only persona-signaling, stereotype- based descriptors, and policies. We hope that our resource will contribute to developing models for automatically detecting new dogwhistles and better understanding the complexity of this phenomenon.

The proposed forward-backward algorithm in "Deriving Vocal Fold Oscillation Information from Recorded Voice Signals Using Models of Phonation" is the reverse-mode algorithm. This algorithm involves the following steps:  1. Forward pass: The input voice signal is passed through a series of layers, including a convolutional layer and a recurrent neural network (RNN). The output of the RNN is a set of feature maps that represent different aspects of the voice signal. 2. Backward pass: The feature maps are then passed through a second RNN, which processes the information in a backwards manner. This allows the model to capture the temporal relationships between the different features of the voice signal. 3. Fusion: The outputs of the forward and backward passes are then combined using a fusion layer, such as a concatenate or average layer. This produces a single representation of the voice signal that captures both its spectral characteristics and its temporal dynamics. 4. Decoding: Finally, the decoded voice signal is produced by passing the fused representation through a vocoder, which maps the high-level representation back to the original audio frequency range.  By using this reverse-mode algorithm, the proposed method in the paper is able to capture the complex dynamics of the vocal folds during phonation, and generate high-quality voice signals that are similar to those produced by a human speaker.

Using random walks to estimate entity centrality on conversation entity graphs improves top precision answer passage ranking over competitive transformer-based baselines, according to experiments conducted in the paper. The entity graph is formed by combining multiple sources of evidence, including previous questions or answer passages from the conversation, and the query itself. The centrality of each entity in the conversation is estimated using random walks, and the passages are reranked based on their centrality scores. The results show an improvement of up to 8.1% in nDCG@3 and 3.6% in P@3 on the CAsT 2019 dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach.

The FLARE method is designed to aid long-form generation with retrieval augmentation, and it decides when and what to retrieve during generation. To answer the query, we need to provide information about the four knowledge-intensive tasks that were evaluated by Jiang et al. using the FLARE method.  Based on the context provided in the query, we can determine that the tasks evaluated by Jiang et al. are likely related to text generation or question answering, as the paper focuses on long-form generation and retrieval augmentation for these tasks. Therefore, the four tasks may be:  1. Multi-hop QA: This task involves generating answers to open- ended questions by traversing multiple documents or sources of information. 2. Text completion: This task involves generating complete sentences or texts based on partial inputs or context. 3. Dialogue generation: This task involves generating natural language responses to given prompts or inputs, often in the form of a conversation. 4. Open-ended question answering: This task involves providing detailed and accurate answers to open-ended questions that require reasoning and comprehension beyond simple keyword matching.  Without additional context, it is difficult to provide more specific information about the tasks evaluated by Jiang et al. using the FLARE method.

The mapping network plays a crucial role in the proposed model by translating the hidden representations of text into the embedding space of the visual models. This allows the multimodal language model to leverage the strong text representations learned during large-scale pretraining and condition on inputs more strongly, resulting in improved performance on image generation tasks. By mapping between the embedding spaces of the LLM and the visual models, GILL is able to generate novel images that are coherent with both the text input and the visual context.

The proposed model in "Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models" demonstrates a wide range of multimodal capabilities, including image retrieval, novel image generation, and multimodal dialogue. The model can process image-and-text inputs and generate novel images, retrieved images, or condition on the input to generate text. The model is also capable of deciding whether to retrieve or generate at inference time, using a learnt decision module that conditions on the hidden representations of the LLM. This allows the model to leverage the strong text representations of the LLM for visual outputs, while still being able to process image-and-text inputs and generate relevant images. Overall, the proposed model demonstrates a wider range of capabilities compared to prior multimodal language models, enabling it to process image-and-text inputs and produce more accurate and high-quality results.

According to the text, "Buggy Races Keep Rolling at Carnegie Mellon," the basics of a buggy are straightforward, but teams are often secretive in how they build the machines, particularly in how they brake, steer, and what types of wheels are used. Each buggy has a body, pushbar for runners to move the machine up the hills, wheels, a safety harness, and driving and braking mechanisms. The text also mentions that drivers are positioned inside the buggy, and Amy Chen demonstrates how a driver is positioned inside of Boson, a Fringe buggy built in 2016.  Based on the context, it appears that the buggies move forward by using their wheels to roll along the ground. The drivers inside the buggy are able to steer and brake the vehicle through the use of mechanisms such as a safety harness and driving and braking mechanisms.

The proposed solution in the BASS paper from Interspeech 2023 to address the issue of training end- to-end speech summarization models on very large inputs is block-wise adaptation for speech summarization. The authors introduce a novel algorithm that predicts a speech summary after consuming a new block of the input speech and allows new summaries to be modified fully if necessary. This approach enables the model to generate a more accurate summary by leveraging the entire input sequence, rather than relying on truncated inputs.

The proposed approach in the paper "Rethinking Voice-Face Correlation: A Geometry View" involves using a geometry-based method to analyze the correlation between voice and face in speech signals. The authors propose a novel framework that leverages the concept of similarity spaces to model the relationship between the vocal and facial expressions of speakers. This approach allows for more accurate and robust analysis of voice-face correlation, which is important for various applications such as emotion recognition, speaker identification, and audio-visual media retrieval.  In this framework, the authors represent the vocal and facial expressions of a speaker as points in a high- dimensional similarity space. They then use geometric algorithms to compute the distance between these points and to identify patterns in the voice and face data that are indicative of specific emotions or speaking styles.  The proposed approach offers several advantages over traditional methods of voice-face correlation analysis. First, it allows for more accurate and robust analysis by leveraging the rich information content in both the vocal and facial expressions of a speaker. Second, it provides a flexible and generalizable framework that can be applied to various types of speech signals and visual data. Finally, it offers a more interpretable and comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between voice and face in speech communication.

In the paper "Imprecise Label Learning: A Unified Framework for Learning with Various Imprecise Label Configurations," ILL (Imprecise Label Learning) leverages various techniques for modeling imprecise label information, including:  1. Probabilistic models: ILL uses probabilistic models, such as Bayesian networks or Markov random fields, to represent the uncertainty in the label information. These models allow the system to reason about the probability of different labels given the input data. 2. Fuzzy logic: ILL employs fuzzy logic techniques to handle imprecise labels by converting them into fuzzy sets. This allows the system to operate on fuzzy labels and perform reasoning based on the membership functions. 3. Graph-based models: ILL uses graph-based models, such as Bayesian graphs or Markov random fields, to represent the relationships between different labels. These models allow the system to reason about the dependencies between labels and the uncertainty in the label information. 4. Deep learning: ILL incorporates deep learning techniques, such as neural networks or deep belief networks, to learn representations of imprecise labels. These representations can be used for tasks such as classification or regression.  By leveraging these techniques, ILL can effectively model imprecise label information and perform reasoning tasks in the presence of uncertainty.

Training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component has shown to improve performance and fluency in various distractors, as reported in the paper. The inclusion of a sufﬁciently inﬂuential ToM reranker during the speaker training process improves speaker per-formances, although the relative gains appear to be much higher when training on easy distractors (Lin et al., 2014). Moreover, the usage of highly weighted ToM listeners leads to significant ﬂuency gains when training on both easy and hard distractors (Yuksekgonul et al., 2022). This suggests that a highly inﬂuential ToM listener during the training process can play an important role in simulated language acquisition, similarly to how it has been hypothesized to play a critical role in human language acquisition (Bergelson & Aslin, 2017a; Yuksekgonul et al., 2022).
